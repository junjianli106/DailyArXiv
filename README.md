| **[Iris RESTful Server and IrisTileSource: An Iris implementation for existing OpenSeaDragon viewers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06615v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Iris File Extension (IFE) is a low overhead performance-oriented whole slide image (WSI) file format designed to improve the image rendering experience for pathologists and simplify image management for system administrators. However, static hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) file servers cannot natively stream subregions of high-resolution image files, such as the IFE. The majority of contemporary WSI viewer systems are designed as browser-based web applications and leverage OpenSeaDragon as the tile-based rendering framework. These systems convert WSI files to Deep Zoom Images (DZI) for compatibility with simple static HTTP file servers. To address this limitation, we have developed the Iris RESTful Server, a low-overhead HTTP server with a RESTful API that is natively compatible with the DICOMweb WADO-RS API. Written in C++ with Boost Beast HTTP and Asio networking libraries atop the public IFE libraries, the server offers both security and high performance. Testing shows that a single Raspberry Pi equivalent system can handle a peak of 5,061 req/s (average 3,883 req/s) with a median latency of 21 ms on a private (i.e. hospital) network. We also developed and merged a new OpenSeaDragon TileSource, compatible with the Iris RESTful API, into the next OpenSeaDragon release, enabling simple and immediate drop-in replacement of DZI images within WSI viewer stacks. Designed as a secure cross-origin resource sharing microservice, this architecture includes detailed deployment instructions for new or existing WSI workflows, and the public examples.restful.irisdigitalpathology.org subdomain is provided as a development tool to accelerate WSI web viewer development.

| **[Foundation Models in Dermatopathology: Skin Tissue Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21664v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17982v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

We built a pipeline to apply previously validated segmentation models of kidney structures and extract quantitative features from these structures. Such quantitative analysis also requires qualitative inspection of results for quality control, exploration, and communication. We extend the Vitessce web-based visualization tool to enable visualization of segmentations of multiple types of functional tissue units, such as, glomeruli, tubules, arteries/arterioles in the kidney. Moreover, we propose a standard representation for files containing multiple segmentation bitmasks, which we define polymorphically, such that existing formats including OME-TIFF, OME-NGFF, AnnData, MuData, and SpatialData can be used. We demonstrate that these methods enable researchers and the broader public to interactively explore datasets containing multiple segmented entities and associated features, including for exploration of renal morphometry of biopsies from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP).</p></details> |  |
| **[Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15138v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semiparametric Gaussian Mixture Model with Spatial Dependence and Its Application to Whole-Slide Image Clustering Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16421v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop here a semiparametric Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) for unsupervised learning with valuable spatial information taken into consideration. Specifically, we assume for each instance a random location. Then, conditional on this random location, we assume for the feature vector a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed SGMM allows the mixing probability to be nonparametrically related to the spatial location. Compared with a classical GMM, SGMM is considerably more flexible and allows the instances from the same class to be spatially clustered. To estimate the SGMM, novel EM algorithms are developed and rigorous asymptotic theories are established. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate our finite sample performance. For a real application, we apply our SGMM method to the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images (WSIs) for breast cancer detection. The SGMM method demonstrates outstanding clustering performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCMIL: A Progressive Representation Learning of Whole Slide Images for Cancer Prognosis Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14403v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/tuuuc/DCMIL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Morphology-Aware Prognostic model for Five-Year Survival Prediction in Colorectal Cancer from H&E Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14800v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally, with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%; HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens, replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between treatments.</p></details> |  |

Our method integrating four key components. Firstly, to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly, we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$ and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method across diverse cancer types.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPADE: Spatial Transcriptomics and Pathology Alignment Using a Mixture of Data Experts for an Expressive Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21857v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMAP: A Multi-Magnification and Prototype-Aware Architecture for Predicting Spatial Gene Expression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11344v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Generalisation of automatic tumour segmentation in histopathological whole-slide images across multiple cancer types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11182v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06113v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications.

| **[A Hierarchical Geometry-guided Transformer for Histological Subtyping of Primary Liver Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05657v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, accepted by IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11846v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientMIL: Efficient Linear-Complexity MIL Method for WSI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23640v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.</p></details> | Submitted to Array |
| **[Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/16812932 , our code is available at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/beetle , and our benchmark is available at https://beetle.grand-challenge.org/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic and Visual Crop-Guided Diffusion Models for Heterogeneous Tissue Synthesis in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17847v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPLE: Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25863v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI) classification by aligning visual features with textual representations, thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization. Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</p></details> |  |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm where one cancer corresponds to one model. However, it naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot utilize the knowledge of other cancers. Although a multi-task learning-like framework has been studied recently, it usually has high demands on computational resources and needs considerable costs in iterative training on ultra-large multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper makes a paradigm shift to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It has three major parts: (i) we curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors); (ii) beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmark, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of transferability; (iii) we further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. We hope CROPKT could serve as an inception and lay the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue.

Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with >92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang9/Rasa.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCORPION: Addressing Scanner-Induced Variability in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20907v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UNSURE 2025 workshop in MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Cluster-Level Sparse Multi-Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11034v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering, within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones. This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles. Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).</p></details> | 12 pages,5 figures |
| **[OCELOT 2023: Cell Detection from Cell-Tissue Interaction Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09153v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses. However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted manuscript of an article published in Medical Image Analysis (Elsevier).

However, existing open-source tools are often distributed as source code or Docker containers, requiring advanced programming skills that hinder accessibility for non-programmers, such as clinicians. Additionally, current models are typically trained on a single dataset and lack flexibility in adjusting confidence levels for predictions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GloFinder, a QuPath plugin designed for single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs with online editing through the graphical user interface (GUI). GloFinder employs CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework utilizing circle representations for precise object localization, with models trained on approximately 160,000 manually annotated glomeruli. To further enhance accuracy, the plugin incorporates Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), an ensemble method that combines confidence scores from multiple CircleNet models to produce refined predictions, achieving superior performance in glomerular detection. GloFinder enables direct visualization and editing of results in QuPath, facilitating seamless interaction for clinicians and providing a powerful tool for nephropathology research and clinical practice.

| **[MSCPT: Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification with Multi-scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11505v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for the weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Hanminghao/MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TMI for possible publication</p></details> |

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing content generation models in computational pathology.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures.

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable and Loosely-Coupled Multimodal Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03408v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records, and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities, making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.</p></details> |  |
| **[MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia, chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima. Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</p></details> |  |

The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

These images can be viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science. When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects. We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs. Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes. We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.</p></details> |  |

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted precision oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/lilab-stanford/ELF)</p></details> |

However, pathology images from different hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features, posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Pathology Co-pilot via Reasoning Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17303v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[HistoViT: Vision Transformer for Accurate and Scalable Histopathological Cancer Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11181v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 Figures |

A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to explained AI in digital pathology and beyond.

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, 38 pages, 22 figures, 35 tables</p></details> |

Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms.

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AHDMIL: Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning for Fast and Accurate Whole-Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05114v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation (AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16 dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times.

However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.</p></details> |  |

LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPAN: Unlocking Pyramid Representations for Gigapixel Histopathological Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09333v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) present fundamental computational challenges due to their gigapixel-scale resolutions and sparse, irregularly distributed informative regions. Conventional patch-based methods inevitably distort spatial relationships or treat patches as independent samples, while traditional attention mechanisms, designed for dense, uniformly distributed data, are computationally impractical for WSIs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse-native computational framework that preserves exact spatial relationships, unlocking advanced modeling techniques and bridging a long-standing gap between WSI analysis and general vision. Based on this framework, we develop Sparse Pyramid Attention Networks (SPAN), incorporating a hierarchical sparse pyramid attention architecture with shifted windows that efficiently directs computational resources to informative regions. SPAN comprises two key modules: Spatial-Adaptive Feature Condensation, which progressively builds multi-scale representations from a single-scale input through sparse downsampling, and Context-Aware Feature Refinement, which captures long-range dependencies via shifted windows and global tokens. Evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate SPAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating both our framework's effectiveness and SPAN's specific advantages in capturing contextual and hierachical representations that existing methods fundamentally cannot model. Our work establishes a new paradigm for WSI analysis that overcomes long-standing computational barriers. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We developed methods to predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists' attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Medical Image Analysis (MEDIA), Elsevier, 2025.

| **[Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[$MV_{Hybrid}$: Improving Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction with Hybrid State Space-Vision Transformer Backbone in Pathology Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00383v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745). Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged 0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little focus on clinical utility.

Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL).

Despite its success, a critical limitation of current MIL methods lies in the underutilization of pre-training for the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches initialize the aggregator randomly and train it from scratch, making performance highly sensitive to the quantity of labeled WSIs and ignoring the abundance of unlabeled WSIs commonly available in clinical settings. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating PreMix as a plug-in module into HIPT yields an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training sizes and datasets. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

Computational quantification of TIME characteristics, such as cell detection and tissue segmentation, can support biomarker development. However, currently available digital pathology datasets of NSCLC for the development of cell detection or tissue segmentation algorithms are limited in scope, lack annotations of clinically prevalent metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i) multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides, with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection, and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides.

Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |

SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text, 2 page references, 2 page appendix; under submission</p></details> |

While recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models. Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.</p></details> |  |

| **[Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08178v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors.

| **[UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20653v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[MeD-3D: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Precise Recurrence Prediction in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07839v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNN-ViTCap: GNN-Enhanced Multiple Instance Learning with Vision Transformers for Whole Slide Image Classification and Captioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07006v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05077v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Automatic Data Curation for Vision Foundation Models in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18709v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02395v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance. To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD) module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF) strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in survival prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLa: Hierarchical Vision-Language Collaboration for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04613v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language (VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment. Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation (CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving over 20% in PCC metrics.

Building on this insight, we integrate AEM regularization into the MIL framework to penalize excessive attention concentration. To address sensitivity to the AEM weight parameter, we implement Cosine Weight Annealing, reducing parameter dependency.

WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing.

To address this, we propose Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables.

However, their massive size and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module (FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams. Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiCo: Multiple Instance Learning with Context-Aware Clustering for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18028v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover, PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs. By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations, PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for wider clinical application.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[HistoART: Histopathology Artifact Detection and Reporting Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00044v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however, other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis, it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach (KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds, out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]), outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978]) and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted for oral presentation at Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

| **[Histopathology Image Report Generation by Vision Language Model with Multimodal In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17645v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism. Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image (WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future advancements in multimodal clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MIDL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.</p></details> | Submitted to TMLR |
| **[Cross-Modality Learning for Predicting IHC Biomarkers from H&E-Stained Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15853v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI: 0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedWSIDD: Federated Whole Slide Image Classification via Dataset Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15365v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[PRISM2: Unlocking Multi-Modal General Pathology AI with Clinical Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13063v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pathology foundation models can provide rich tile-level representations but fall short of delivering general-purpose clinical utility without further extensive model development. These models lack whole-slide image (WSI) understanding and are not trained with large-scale diagnostic data, limiting their performance on diverse downstream tasks. We introduce PRISM2, a multi-modal slide-level foundation model trained via clinical dialogue to enable scalable, generalizable pathology AI. PRISM2 is trained on nearly 700,000 specimens (2.3 million WSIs) paired with real-world clinical diagnostic reports in a two-stage process. In Stage 1, a vision-language model is trained using contrastive and captioning objectives to align whole slide embeddings with textual clinical diagnosis. In Stage 2, the language model is unfrozen to enable diagnostic conversation and extract more clinically meaningful representations from hidden states. PRISM2 achieves strong performance on diagnostic and biomarker prediction tasks, outperforming prior slide-level models including PRISM and TITAN. It also introduces a zero-shot yes/no classification approach that surpasses CLIP-style methods without prompt tuning or class enumeration. By aligning visual features with clinical reasoning, PRISM2 improves generalization on both data-rich and low-sample tasks, offering a scalable path forward for building general pathology AI agents capable of assisting diagnostic and prognostic decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Based Quality Control of Histopathology Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03289v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We developed a software pipeline for quality control (QC) of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) that segments various regions, such as blurs of different levels, tissue regions, tissue folds, and pen marks. Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[The Iris File Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10009v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A modern digital pathology vendor-agnostic binary slide format specifically targeting the unmet need of efficient real-time transfer and display has not yet been established. The growing adoption of digital pathology only intensifies the need for an intermediary digital slide format that emphasizes performance for use between slide servers and image management software. The DICOM standard is a well-established format widely used for the long-term storage of both images and associated critical metadata. However, it was inherently designed for radiology rather than digital pathology, a discipline that imposes a unique set of performance requirements due to high-speed multi-pyramidal rendering within whole slide viewer applications. Here we introduce the Iris file extension, a binary container specification explicitly designed for performance-oriented whole slide image viewer systems. The Iris file extension specification is explicit and straightforward, adding modern compression support, a dynamic structure with fully optional metadata features, computationally trivial deep file validation, corruption recovery capabilities, and slide annotations. In addition to the file specification document, we provide source code to allow for (de)serialization and validation of a binary stream against the standard. We also provide corresponding binary builds with C++, Python, and JavaScript language support. Finally, we provide full encoder and decoder implementation source code, as well as binary builds (part of the separate Iris Codec Community module), with language bindings for C++ and Python, allowing for easy integration with existing WSI solutions. We provide the Iris File Extension specification openly to the community in the form of a Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative 4.0 International license.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Semi-Automated Quality Assurance in Digital Pathology: Tile Classification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10916v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology, where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis. Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation. We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues. From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together (chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.</p></details> |  |

Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Single GPU Task Adaptation of Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05184v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Computation- and Communication-efficient Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02628v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance across a wide range of applications, current computational pathology models face significant diagnostic efficiency challenges due to their reliance on high-magnification whole-slide image analysis. This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility, especially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring efficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.</p></details> |  |

However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models.

However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation.

However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research.

However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore, we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies.

| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

First, we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI) to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores, achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&E-stained WSIs of breast cancer.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages, 9 Figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Mutual Knowledge Distillation in Bi-Directional Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12074v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[PathBench: A comprehensive comparison benchmark for pathology foundation models towards precision oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20202v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Context Matters: Query-aware Dynamic Long Sequence Modeling of Gigapixel Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18984v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive number of patches in gigapixel images. While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which achieves a theoretically bounded approximation of full self-attention while delivering practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07999v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables + Supplementary materials Preprint is pre-peer review version.

| **[Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Linearity: Squeeze-and-Recalibrate Blocks for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15504v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters and no architectural changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04045v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14783v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12711v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Quality Evaluation of Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images Based on Content Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13875v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS) diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in terms of speed and consistency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

| **[HISTAI: An Open-Source, Large-Scale Whole Slide Image Dataset for Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12120v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Digital Pathology (DP), particularly through artificial intelligence and Foundation Models, have underscored the importance of large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated datasets. Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions.

| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Pathology Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy in pathology image analysis. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490K samples from diverse pathology tasks, we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Continual Learning for Whole Slide Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10649v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions, preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data. A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs, and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNCAF: A GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework for Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Semantic Segmentation in WSI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08430v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized clusters of immune cells, whose maturity and area can be quantified in whole slide image (WSI) for various prognostic tasks. Existing methods for assessing these characteristics typically rely on cell proxy tasks and require additional post-processing steps. In this work, We focus on a novel task-TLS Semantic Segmentation (TLS-SS)-which segments both the regions and maturation stages of TLS in WSI in an end-to-end manner. Due to the extensive scale of WSI and patch-based segmentation strategies, TLS-SS necessitates integrating from neighboring patches to guide target patch (target) segmentation. Previous techniques often employ on multi-resolution approaches, constraining the capacity to leverage the broader neighboring context while tend to preserve coarse-grained information. To address this, we propose a GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework (GNCAF), which progressively aggregates multi-hop neighboring context from the target and employs a self-attention mechanism to guide the segmentation of the target. GNCAF can be integrated with various segmentation models to enhance their ability to perceive contextual information outside of the patch. We build two TLS-SS datasets, called TCGA-COAD and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former (comprising 225 WSIs and 5041 TLSs) publicly available. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNCAF, achieving a maximum of 22.08% and 26.57% improvement in mF1 and mIoU, respectively. Additionally, we also validate the task scalability of GNCAF on segmentation of lymph node metastases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Similarity Proportion Loss for Classifying Skeletal Muscle Recovery Stages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04150v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental analysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover mechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional approach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging and expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological information of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with automated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a quantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully labeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a weakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However, current LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature extractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing recovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the loss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale Learning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion loss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor by using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our model with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in classification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI2024 workshop ADSMI in Morocco (oral) [Peer-reviewed]</p></details> |

The identification and segmentation of these lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics, necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset (ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13754v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/CMSwinKAN.</p></details> | 10pages, 8 figures |
| **[Beyond the Monitor: Mixed Reality Visualization and AI for Enhanced Digital Pathology Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02780v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging.

However, the black-box nature of these models often limits their clinical adoption. We introduce GRAPHITE (Graph-based Interpretable Tissue Examination), a post-hoc explainable framework designed for breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. GRAPHITE employs a multiscale approach, extracting patches at various magnification levels, constructing an hierarchical graph, and utilising graph attention networks (GAT) with scalewise attention (SAN) to capture scale-dependent features. We trained the model on 140 tumour TMA cores and four benign whole slide images from which 140 benign samples were created, and tested it on 53 pathologist-annotated TMA samples. GRAPHITE outperformed traditional XAI methods, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.56, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, and a threshold robustness (ThR) of 0.70, indicating that the model maintains high performance across a wide range of thresholds. In clinical utility, GRAPHITE achieved the highest area under the decision curve (AUDC) of 4.17e+5, indicating reliable decision support across thresholds.

| **[Lifelong Whole Slide Image Analysis: Online Vision-Language Adaptation and Past-to-Present Gradient Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01984v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervision Enhances Instance-based Multiple Instance Learning Methods in Digital Pathology: A Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01109v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as the best solution for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging (SPIE)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we analyze why attention-based methods tend to rely on spurious correlations in their predictions. Furthermore, we revisit max-pooling-based approaches and examine the reasons behind the underperformance of existing methods. We argue that well-trained max-pooling-based MIL models can make predictions based on causal factors and avoid relying on spurious correlations. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective max-pooling-based MIL method (FocusMIL) that outperforms existing mainstream attention-based methods on two datasets. In this position paper, we advocate renewed attention to max-pooling-based methods to achieve more robust and interpretable predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Resolution Pathology-Language Pre-training Model with Text-Guided Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18856v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification, tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization across different resolutions. Pre-trained on a comprehensive TCGA dataset with 34 million image-language pairs at various resolutions, our fine-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts across multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in CPath.

| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

| **[Iris: A Next Generation Digital Pathology Rendering Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15437v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. Our source code and experimental results will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, conference submission</p></details> |

However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel lightweight graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation mechanism replacing traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a high margin in terms of balanced accuracy, while being significantly smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers, is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters, and can generalize when using features from different backbones. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology.

Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[TUMLS: Trustful Fully Unsupervised Multi-Level Segmentation for Whole Slide Images of Histology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12718v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However, challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs), high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology (TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It selects representative patches from each identified group based on an uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially, this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016. Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset, outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in advancing the field of digital pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, 42 references</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Semi-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification by Two-level Cross Consistency Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12132v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical pathological diagnosis. It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |

Identifying biomarkers for personalized treatment is crucial. While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised model called DomainGCN that employs a graph convolution neural network (GCN) and incorporates domain-specific knowledge of ulcer features, specifically, the presence of epithelium, lymphocytes, and debris for WSI-level ulcer prediction in IBD. We demonstrate that DomainGCN outperforms various state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and show the added value of domain knowledge.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work accepted at ISBI 2025</p></details> |

In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate the performance of several Deep Learning (DL) methods for cell detection in Papanicolaou-stained cytological Whole Slide Images (WSIs), focusing on accuracy of predictions and computational efficiency. We examine recentoff-the-shelf algorithms as well as custom-designed detectors, applying them to two datasets: the CNSeg Dataset and the Oral Cancer (OC) Dataset. Our comparison includes well-established segmentation methods such as StarDist, Cellpose, and the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), alongside centroid-based Fully Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) approaches. We introduce a suitable evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of predictions based on the distance from ground truth positions. We also explore the impact of dataset size and data augmentation techniques on model performance. Results show that centroid-based methods, particularly the Improved Fully Convolutional Regression Network (IFCRN) method, outperform segmentation-based methods in terms of both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. This study highlights the potential of centroid-based detectors as a preferred option for cell detection in resource-limited environments, offering faster processing times and lower GPU memory usage without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, SCIA2025</p></details> |

To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model. First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks. Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform. Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model. Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality. The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48. By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes. Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

In this study, we investigated whether deep learning algorithms can predict patients' risk of recurrence by analyzing the pathology images of their cancer histology.We analyzed 125 hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from 125 patients across two institutions (National Cancer Center and Korea University Medical Center Guro Hospital) to predict breast cancer recurrence risk using deep learning. Sensitivity reached 0.857, 0.746, and 0.529 for low, intermediate, and high-risk categories, respectively, with specificity of 0.816, 0.803, and 0.972, and a Pearson correlation of 0.61 with histological grade. Class activation maps highlighted features like tubule formation and mitotic rate, suggesting a cost-effective approach to risk stratification, pending broader validation. These findings suggest that deep learning models trained exclusively on hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images can approximate genomic assay results, offering a cost-effective and scalable tool for breast cancer recurrence risk assessment. However, further validation using larger and more balanced datasets is needed to confirm the clinical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Vision Transformers with Autoencoders and Explainable AI for Cancer Patient Risk Stratification Using Whole Slide Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04749v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitating accurate diagnosis and prognosis. Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has become an integral part of clinical workflows with advancements in digital pathology. While various studies have utilized WSIs, their extracted features may not fully capture the most relevant pathological information, and their lack of interpretability limits clinical adoption. In this paper, we propose PATH-X, a framework that integrates Vision Transformers (ViT) and Autoencoders with SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to enhance model explainability for patient stratification and risk prediction using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A representative image slice is selected from each WSI, and numerical feature embeddings are extracted using Google's pre-trained ViT. These features are then compressed via an autoencoder and used for unsupervised clustering and classification tasks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis is applied to evaluate stratification into two and three risk groups. SHAP is used to identify key contributing features, which are mapped onto histopathological slices to provide spatial context. PATH-X demonstrates strong performance in breast and glioma cancers, where a sufficient number of WSIs enabled robust stratification. However, performance in lung cancer was limited due to data availability, emphasizing the need for larger datasets to enhance model reliability and clinical applicability.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[A Novel Approach to Linking Histology Images with DNA Methylation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05403v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to DNA. Abnormal methylation patterns can disrupt gene expression and have been linked to cancer development. To quantify DNA methylation, specialized assays are typically used. However, these assays are often costly and have lengthy processing times, which limits their widespread availability in routine clinical practice. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) for the majority of cancer patients can be more readily available. As such, given the ready availability of WSIs, there is a compelling need to explore the potential relationship between WSIs and DNA methylation patterns. To address this, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network based weakly supervised learning framework to predict the methylation state of gene groups exhibiting coherent patterns across samples. Using data from three cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) - TCGA-LGG (Brain Lower Grade Glioma), TCGA-GBM (Glioblastoma Multiforme) ($n$=729) and TCGA-KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) ($n$=511) - we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significantly higher AUROC scores than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, by more than $20\%$. We conduct gene set enrichment analyses on the gene groups and show that majority of the gene groups are significantly enriched in important hallmarks and pathways. We also generate spatially enriched heatmaps to further investigate links between histological patterns and DNA methylation states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that explores association of spatially resolved histological patterns with gene group methylation states across multiple cancer types using weakly supervised deep learning.</p></details> |  |

A total of 731 Mohs slides from 51 patients with BCCs were used in this study, with 91 containing tumor and 640 without tumor which was defined as non-tumor. The dataset was employed to train U-Net based models that segment tumor and non-tumor regions on the slides. The segmented patches were classified as tumor, or non-tumor to produce predictions for whole slide images (WSIs). For the segmentation phase, the deep learning model success was measured using a Dice score with 0.70 and 0.67 value, area under the curve (AUC) score with 0.98 and 0.96 for tumor and non-tumor, respectively. For the tumor classification, an AUC of 0.98 for patch-based detection, and AUC of 0.91 for slide-based detection was obtained on the test dataset. We present an AI system that can detect tumors and non-tumors in Mohs slides with high success. Deep learning can aid Mohs surgeons and dermatopathologists in making more accurate decisions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Artificial intelligence application in lymphoma diagnosis: from Convolutional Neural Network to Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04025v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, vision transformers were shown to be capable of outperforming convolutional neural networks when pretrained on sufficiently large datasets. Vision transformer models show good accuracy on large scale datasets, with features of multi-modal training. Due to their promising feature detection, we aim to explore vision transformer models for diagnosis of anaplastic large cell lymphoma versus classical Hodgkin lymphoma using pathology whole slide images of HE slides. We compared the classification performance of the vision transformer to our previously designed convolutional neural network on the same dataset. The dataset includes whole slide images of HE slides for 20 cases, including 10 cases in each diagnostic category. From each whole slide image, 60 image patches having size of 100 by 100 pixels and at magnification of 20 were obtained to yield 1200 image patches, from which 90 percent were used for training, 9 percent for validation, and 10 percent for testing. The test results from the convolutional neural network model had previously shown an excellent diagnostic accuracy of 100 percent. The test results from the vision transformer model also showed a comparable accuracy at 100 percent. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of predictive performance between a vision transformer model and a convolutional neural network model using the same dataset of lymphoma. Overall, convolutional neural network has a more mature architecture than vision transformer and is usually the best choice when large scale pretraining is not an available option. Nevertheless, our current study shows comparable and excellent accuracy of vision transformer compared to that of convolutional neural network even with a relatively small dataset of anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[HMIL: Hierarchical Multi-Instance Learning for Fine-Grained Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07660v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained classification of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential in precision oncology, enabling precise cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies. The core of this task involves distinguishing subtle morphological variations within the same broad category of gigapixel-resolution images, which presents a significant challenge. While the multi-instance learning (MIL) paradigm alleviates the computational burden of WSIs, existing MIL methods often overlook hierarchical label correlations, treating fine-grained classification as a flat multi-class classification task. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel hierarchical multi-instance learning (HMIL) framework. By facilitating on the hierarchical alignment of inherent relationships between different hierarchy of labels at instance and bag level, our approach provides a more structured and informative learning process. Specifically, HMIL incorporates a class-wise attention mechanism that aligns hierarchical information at both the instance and bag levels. Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability for fine-grained classification and a curriculum-based dynamic weighting module to adaptively balance the hierarchical feature during training. Extensive experiments on our large-scale cytology cervical cancer (CCC) dataset and two public histology datasets, BRACS and PANDA, demonstrate the state-of-the-art class-wise and overall performance of our HMIL framework.

We present BioX-CPath, an explainable graph neural network architecture for whole slide image (WSI) classification that leverages both spatial and semantic features across multiple stains. At its core, BioX-CPath introduces a novel Stain-Aware Attention Pooling (SAAP) module that generates biologically meaningful, stain-aware patient embeddings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Disease multistain datasets. Beyond performance metrics, BioX-CPath provides interpretable insights through stain attention scores, entropy measures, and stain interaction scores, that permit measuring model alignment with known pathological mechanisms. This biological grounding, combined with strong classification performance, makes BioX-CPath particularly suitable for clinical applications where interpretability is key.

| **[GECKO: Gigapixel Vision-Concept Contrastive Pretraining in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01009v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) aggregator enables the derivation of Whole Slide Image (WSI)-level embeddings from patch-level representations without supervision. While recent multimodal MIL pretraining approaches leveraging auxiliary modalities have demonstrated performance gains over unimodal WSI pretraining, the acquisition of these additional modalities necessitates extensive clinical profiling. This requirement increases costs and limits scalability in existing WSI datasets lacking such paired modalities. To address this, we propose Gigapixel Vision-Concept Knowledge Contrastive pretraining (GECKO), which aligns WSIs with a Concept Prior derived from the available WSIs. First, we derive an inherently interpretable concept prior by computing the similarity between each WSI patch and textual descriptions of predefined pathology concepts. GECKO then employs a dual-branch MIL network: one branch aggregates patch embeddings into a WSI-level deep embedding, while the other aggregates the concept prior into a corresponding WSI-level concept embedding. Both aggregated embeddings are aligned using a contrastive objective, thereby pretraining the entire dual-branch MIL model. Moreover, when auxiliary modalities such as transcriptomics data are available, GECKO seamlessly integrates them. Across five diverse tasks, GECKO consistently outperforms prior unimodal and multimodal pretraining approaches while also delivering clinically meaningful interpretability that bridges the gap between computational models and pathology expertise. Code is made available at https://github.com/bmi-imaginelab/GECKO</p></details> |  |
| **[Learned Image Compression and Restoration for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23862v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology images play a crucial role in medical diagnostics, but their ultra-high resolution and large file sizes pose significant challenges for storage, transmission, and real-time visualization. To address these issues, we propose CLERIC, a novel deep learning-based image compression framework designed specifically for whole slide images (WSIs). CLERIC integrates a learnable lifting scheme and advanced convolutional techniques to enhance compression efficiency while preserving critical pathological details. Our framework employs a lifting-scheme transform in the analysis stage to decompose images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling more structured latent representations. These components are processed through parallel encoders incorporating Deformable Residual Blocks (DRB) and Recurrent Residual Blocks (R2B) to improve feature extraction and spatial adaptability. The synthesis stage applies an inverse lifting transform for effective image reconstruction, ensuring high-fidelity restoration of fine-grained tissue structures. We evaluate CLERIC on a digital pathology image dataset and compare its performance against state-of-the-art learned image compression (LIC) models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLERIC achieves superior rate-distortion (RD) performance, significantly reducing storage requirements while maintaining high diagnostic image quality. Our study highlights the potential of deep learning-based compression in digital pathology, facilitating efficient data management and long-term storage while ensuring seamless integration into clinical workflows and AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

| **[MIL vs. Aggregation: Evaluating Patient-Level Survival Prediction Strategies Using Graph-Based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23042v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oncologists often rely on a multitude of data, including whole-slide images (WSIs), to guide therapeutic decisions, aiming for the best patient outcome. However, predicting the prognosis of cancer patients can be a challenging task due to tumor heterogeneity and intra-patient variability, and the complexity of analyzing WSIs. These images are extremely large, containing billions of pixels, making direct processing computationally expensive and requiring specialized methods to extract relevant information. Additionally, multiple WSIs from the same patient may capture different tumor regions, some being more informative than others. This raises a fundamental question: Should we use all WSIs to characterize the patient, or should we identify the most representative slide for prognosis? Our work seeks to answer this question by performing a comparison of various strategies for predicting survival at the WSI and patient level. The former treats each WSI as an independent sample, mimicking the strategy adopted in other works, while the latter comprises methods to either aggregate the predictions of the several WSIs or automatically identify the most relevant slide using multiple-instance learning (MIL). Additionally, we evaluate different Graph Neural Networks architectures under these strategies. We conduct our experiments using the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which comprises patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Our results show that MIL-based selection improves accuracy, suggesting that choosing the most representative slide benefits survival prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area. The code is https://github.com/DearCaat/E2E-WSI-ABMILX.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published on NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Optimal Control of Muscle Force Sharing During Pathological Gait](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17456v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides, possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.</p></details> |  |

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables.

| **[Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.</p></details> | 38 Pages, 8 Figures |
| **[SPADE: Spatial Transcriptomics and Pathology Alignment Using a Mixture of Data Experts for an Expressive Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21857v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning.

| **[G2L:From Giga-Scale to Cancer-Specific Large-Scale Pathology Foundation Models via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11176v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.</p></details> |  |

While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

This study developed and validated the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9 items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426). Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered (network analysis) approaches revealed a 5-10% prevalence rate, a symptom network structure similar to IGD, and predictive factors related to psychological distress and functional impairment. These findings indicate that PUGenAI shares features of the emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD rather than the competence-based type. These results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while avoiding over-pathologizing.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 10\% compared to base models. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current MLMs for speech-language pathology applications, underscoring the need for further research and targeted development.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Prior work often relies on domain fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3 dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks, YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of 23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting and benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal and precision oncology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20475v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations. We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the PIPPI Workshop of MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamline pathology foundation model by cross-magnification distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23097v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |

While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4% "Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.</p></details> |  |

Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |

A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area.

This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enrich and Detect: Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17023v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlights)</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.13725</p></details> |

However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based system to improve cribriform pattern detection. Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430 patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261 slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort. Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62. Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions for prostate cancer patients.</p></details> |  |

Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

In this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning (DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, accepted conference paper at SPIE REMOTE SENSING, 3-7 September 2023, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p></details> |

Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21191v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods.

Methods: Glo-UMF decouples quantification tasks by constructing three dedicated deep models: an ultrastructure segmentation model, a glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) region classification model, and an electron-dense deposits (EDD) detection model. Their outputs are integrated through a post-processing workflow with adaptive GFB cropping and measurement location screening, enhancing measurement reliability and providing comprehensive quantitative results that overcome the limitations of traditional grading. Results: Trained on 372 electron microscopy images, Glo-UMF enables simultaneous quantification of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and EDD location. In 115 test cases spanning 9 renal pathological types, the automated quantification results showed strong agreement with pathological reports, with an average processing time of 4.23$\pm$0.48 seconds per case on a CPU environment. Conclusions: The modular design of Glo-UMF allows for flexible extensibility, supporting the joint quantification of multiple features.

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

In this study we developed a robust system for automated extraction of the specific cancer types for the purpose of supporting precision oncology research. from pathology reports using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model. This model significantly outperformed the baseline model and a Large Language Model, Mistral 7B, achieving F1_Bertscore 0.98 and overall exact match of 80.61%. This fine-tuning approach demonstrates the potential for scalability that can integrate seamlessly into the molecular tumour board process. Fine-tuning domain-specific models for precision tasks in oncology, may pave the way for more efficient and accurate clinical information extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can human clinical rationales improve the performance and explainability of clinical text classification models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21302v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649 electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority, training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale coverage) compared to training on additional reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiagR1: A Vision-Language Model Trained via Reinforcement Learning for Digestive Pathology Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18433v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Health Intelligence, in conjunction with the Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March 2025</p></details> |

Prior studies have trained bespoke cancer survival prediction models from unimodal or multimodal TCGA data. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive meaningful feature embeddings, agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. We demonstrate the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we modernize survival modeling by leveraging FMs and information extraction from pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables, updated with acknowledgements and declarations of interest</p></details> |

Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global explainability of a deep abstaining classifier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01202v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a global explainability method to characterize sources of errors in the histology prediction task of our real-world multitask convolutional neural network (MTCNN)-based deep abstaining classifier (DAC), for automated annotation of cancer pathology reports from NCI-SEER registries. Our classifier was trained and evaluated on 1.04 million hand-annotated samples and makes simultaneous predictions of cancer site, subsite, histology, laterality, and behavior for each report. The DAC framework enables the model to abstain on ambiguous reports and/or confusing classes to achieve a target accuracy on the retained (non-abstained) samples, but at the cost of decreased coverage. Requiring 97% accuracy on the histology task caused our model to retain only 22% of all samples, mostly the less ambiguous and common classes. Local explainability with the GradInp technique provided a computationally efficient way of obtaining contextual reasoning for thousands of individual predictions. Our method, involving dimensionality reduction of approximately 13000 aggregated local explanations, enabled global identification of sources of errors as hierarchical complexity among classes, label noise, insufficient information, and conflicting evidence. This suggests several strategies such as exclusion criteria, focused annotation, and reduced penalties for errors involving hierarchically related classes to iteratively improve our DAC in this complex real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, these LLMs typically have several billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems. Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on nearly 2.7M clinical notes and over 515K pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on two cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that the CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results with F1 score of 91.78% on phenotyping extraction and 86.81% on disganois generation. It outperformed existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 9.23%. Additionally, the CancerLLM demonstrated its efficiency on time and GPU usage, and robustness comparing with other LLMs. We demonstrated that CancerLLM can potentially provide an effective and robust solution to advance clinical research and practice in cancer domain</p></details> | <details><summary>new v...</summary><p>new version, add the RAG version of cancerLLM</p></details> |

Method: We analyzed 2,258 colonoscopy images with corresponding pathology reports from 428 patients. We preprocessed all images using standardized techniques (resizing, normalization, and augmentation) and implemented a rigorous comparative framework evaluating 11 distinct models: ResNet50, 4 CMLs (random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree), two specialized contrastive vision language encoders (CLIP, BiomedCLIP), and three general-purpose VLMs ( GPT-4 Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus). Our performance assessment focused on two clinical tasks: polyp detection (CADe) and classification (CADx). Result: In polyp detection, ResNet50 achieved the best performance (F1: 91.35%, AUROC: 0.98), followed by BiomedCLIP (F1: 88.68%, AUROC: [AS1] ). GPT-4 demonstrated comparable effectiveness to traditional machine learning approaches (F1: 81.02%, AUROC: [AS2] ), outperforming other general-purpose VLMs. For polyp classification, performance rankings remained consistent but with lower overall metrics. ResNet50 maintained the highest efficacy (weighted F1: 74.94%), while GPT-4 demonstrated moderate capability (weighted F1: 41.18%), significantly exceeding other VLMs (Claude-3-Opus weighted F1: 25.54%, Gemini 1.5 Pro weighted F1: 6.17%). Conclusion: CNNs remain superior for both CADx and CADe tasks. However, VLMs like BioMedCLIP and GPT-4 may be useful for polyp detection tasks where training CNNs is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/aminkhalafi/CML-vs-LLM-on-Polyp-Detection.

While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study.

Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |

However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |
