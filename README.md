| **[Deep Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11097v1)** | 2021-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of whole slide imaging has increased the demand for effective and efficient gigapixel image analysis. Deep learning is at the forefront of computer vision, showcasing significant improvements over previous methodologies on visual understanding. However, whole slide images have billions of pixels and suffer from high morphological heterogeneity as well as from different types of artefacts. Collectively, these impede the conventional use of deep learning. For the clinical translation of deep learning solutions to become a reality, these challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, we review work on the interdisciplinary attempt of training deep neural networks using whole slide images, and highlight the different ideas underlying these methodologies.</p></details> |  |

| **[GloFlow: Global Image Alignment for Creation of Whole Slide Images for Pathology from Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15269v2)** | 2020-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of deep learning to pathology assumes the existence of digital whole slide images of pathology slides. However, slide digitization is bottlenecked by the high cost of precise motor stages in slide scanners that are needed for position information used for slide stitching. We propose GloFlow, a two-stage method for creating a whole slide image using optical flow-based image registration with global alignment using a computationally tractable graph-pruning approach. In the first stage, we train an optical flow predictor to predict pairwise translations between successive video frames to approximate a stitch. In the second stage, this approximate stitch is used to create a neighborhood graph to produce a corrected stitch. On a simulated dataset of video scans of WSIs, we find that our method outperforms known approaches to slide-stitching, and stitches WSIs resembling those produced by slide scanners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) at NeurIPS 2020 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |
| **[WISE: A Framework for Gigapixel Whole-Slide-Image Lossless Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18074v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) have revolutionized medical analysis by presenting high-resolution images of the whole tissue slide. Despite avoiding the physical storage of the slides, WSIs require considerable data volume, which makes the storage and maintenance of WSI records costly and unsustainable. To this end, this work presents the first investigation of lossless compression of WSI images. Interestingly, we find that most existing compression methods fail to compress the WSI images effectively. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the failure of existing compressors is mainly due to information irregularity in WSI images. To resolve this issue, we developed a simple yet effective lossless compressor called WISE, specifically designed for WSI images. WISE employs a hierarchical encoding strategy to extract effective bits, reducing the entropy of the image and then adopting a dictionary-based method to handle the irregular frequency patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that WISE can effectively compress the gigapixel WSI images to 36 times on average and up to 136 times.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ink removal from histopathology whole slide images by combining classification, detection and image generation models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04385v1)** | 2019-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slides are routinely marked by pathologists using permanent ink markers that should not be removed as they form part of the medical record. Often tumour regions are marked up for the purpose of highlighting features or other downstream processing such an gene sequencing. Once digitised there is no established method for removing this information from the whole slide images limiting its usability in research and study. Removal of marker ink from these high-resolution whole slide images is non-trivial and complex problem as they contaminate different regions and in an inconsistent manner. We propose an efficient pipeline using convolution neural networks that results in ink-free images without compromising information and image resolution. Our pipeline includes a sequential classical convolution neural network for accurate classification of contaminated image tiles, a fast region detector and a domain adaptive cycle consistent adversarial generative model for restoration of foreground pixels. Both quantitative and qualitative results on four different whole slide images show that our approach yields visually coherent ink-free whole slide images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019, Venice, Italy</p></details> |
| **[HistomicsML2.0: Fast interactive machine learning for whole slide imaging data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11547v1)** | 2020-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extracting quantitative phenotypic information from whole-slide images presents significant challenges for investigators who are not experienced in developing image analysis algorithms. We present new software that enables rapid learn-by-example training of machine learning classifiers for detection of histologic patterns in whole-slide imaging datasets. HistomicsML2.0 uses convolutional networks to be readily adaptable to a variety of applications, provides a web-based user interface, and is available as a software container to simplify deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning for Computational Pathology on Gigapixel Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10190v2)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning-based computational pathology algorithms have demonstrated profound ability to excel in a wide array of tasks that range from characterization of well known morphological phenotypes to predicting non-human-identifiable features from histology such as molecular alterations. However, the development of robust, adaptable, and accurate deep learning-based models often rely on the collection and time-costly curation large high-quality annotated training data that should ideally come from diverse sources and patient populations to cater for the heterogeneity that exists in such datasets. Multi-centric and collaborative integration of medical data across multiple institutions can naturally help overcome this challenge and boost the model performance but is limited by privacy concerns amongst other difficulties that may arise in the complex data sharing process as models scale towards using hundreds of thousands of gigapixel whole slide images. In this paper, we introduce privacy-preserving federated learning for gigapixel whole slide images in computational pathology using weakly-supervised attention multiple instance learning and differential privacy. We evaluated our approach on two different diagnostic problems using thousands of histology whole slide images with only slide-level labels. Additionally, we present a weakly-supervised learning framework for survival prediction and patient stratification from whole slide images and demonstrate its effectiveness in a federated setting. Our results show that using federated learning, we can effectively develop accurate weakly supervised deep learning models from distributed data silos without direct data sharing and its associated complexities, while also preserving differential privacy using randomized noise generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of Different Methods for Tissue Segmentation in Histopathological Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05990v2)** | 2017-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue segmentation is an important pre-requisite for efficient and accurate diagnostics in digital pathology. However, it is well known that whole-slide scanners can fail in detecting all tissue regions, for example due to the tissue type, or due to weak staining because their tissue detection algorithms are not robust enough. In this paper, we introduce two different convolutional neural network architectures for whole slide image segmentation to accurately identify the tissue sections. We also compare the algorithms to a published traditional method. We collected 54 whole slide images with differing stains and tissue types from three laboratories to validate our algorithms. We show that while the two methods do not differ significantly they outperform their traditional counterpart (Jaccard index of 0.937 and 0.929 vs. 0.870, p < 0.01).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017</p></details> |
| **[SparseConvMIL: Sparse Convolutional Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02726v2)** | 2021-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the preferred approach for whole slide image classification. However, most MIL approaches do not exploit the interdependencies of tiles extracted from a whole slide image, which could provide valuable cues for classification. This paper presents a novel MIL approach that exploits the spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole slide images. To do so, a sparse map is built from tiles embeddings, and is then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art performance over popular MIL approaches on the classification of cancer subtype involving 10000 whole slide images. Our results suggest that the proposed approach might (i) improve the representation learning of instances and (ii) exploit the context of instance embeddings to enhance the classification performance. The code of this work is open-source at {github censored for review}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tissue Concepts v2: A Supervised Foundation Model For Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05742v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing Whole Slide Cancer Image Features with Hilbert Curves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06469v1)** | 2020-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regions of Interest (ROI) contain morphological features in pathology whole slide images (WSI) are delimited with polygons[1]. These polygons are often represented in either a textual notation (with the array of edges) or in a binary mask form. Textual notations have an advantage of human readability and portability, whereas, binary mask representations are more useful as the input and output of feature-extraction pipelines that employ deep learning methodologies. For any given whole slide image, more than a million cellular features can be segmented generating a corresponding number of polygons. The corpus of these segmentations for all processed whole slide images creates various challenges for filtering specific areas of data for use in interactive real-time and multi-scale displays and analysis. Simple range queries of image locations do not scale and, instead, spatial indexing schemes are required. In this paper we propose using Hilbert Curves simultaneously for spatial indexing and as a polygonal ROI representation. This is achieved by using a series of Hilbert Curves[2] creating an efficient and inherently spatially-indexed machine-usable form. The distinctive property of Hilbert curves that enables both mask and polygon delimitation of ROIs is that the elements of the vector extracted ro describe morphological features maintain their relative positions for different scales of the same image.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Region of Interest Detection in Melanocytic Skin Tumor Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16457v1)** | 2022-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated region of interest detection in histopathological image analysis is a challenging and important topic with tremendous potential impact on clinical practice. The deep-learning methods used in computational pathology help us to reduce costs and increase the speed and accuracy of regions of interest detection and cancer diagnosis. In this work, we propose a patch-based region of interest detection method for melanocytic skin tumor whole-slide images. We work with a dataset that contains 165 primary melanomas and nevi Hematoxylin and Eosin whole-slide images and build a deep-learning method. The proposed method performs well on a hold-out test data set including five TCGA-SKCM slides (accuracy of 93.94\% in slide classification task and intersection over union rate of 41.27\% in the region of interest detection task), showing the outstanding performance of our model on melanocytic skin tumor. Even though we test the experiments on the skin tumor dataset, our work could also be extended to other medical image detection problems, such as various tumors' classification and prediction, to help and benefit the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of different tumors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MedNeurIPS 2022</p></details> |
| **[Overcoming the limitations of patch-based learning to detect cancer in whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00617v1)** | 2020-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) pose unique challenges when training deep learning models. They are very large which makes it necessary to break each image down into smaller patches for analysis, image features have to be extracted at multiple scales in order to capture both detail and context, and extreme class imbalances may exist. Significant progress has been made in the analysis of these images, thanks largely due to the availability of public annotated datasets. We postulate, however, that even if a method scores well on a challenge task, this success may not translate to good performance in a more clinically relevant workflow. Many datasets consist of image patches which may suffer from data curation bias; other datasets are only labelled at the whole slide level and the lack of annotations across an image may mask erroneous local predictions so long as the final decision is correct. In this paper, we outline the differences between patch or slide-level classification versus methods that need to localize or segment cancer accurately across the whole slide, and we experimentally verify that best practices differ in both cases. We apply a binary cancer detection network on post neoadjuvant therapy breast cancer WSIs to find the tumor bed outlining the extent of cancer, a task which requires sensitivity and precision across the whole slide. We extensively study multiple design choices and their effects on the outcome, including architectures and augmentations. Furthermore, we propose a negative data sampling strategy, which drastically reduces the false positive rate (7% on slide level) and improves each metric pertinent to our problem, with a 15% reduction in the error of tumor extent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regional Registration of Whole Slide Image Stacks Containing Highly Deformed Artefacts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12588v1)** | 2020-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation: High resolution 2D whole slide imaging provides rich information about the tissue structure. This information can be a lot richer if these 2D images can be stacked into a 3D tissue volume. A 3D analysis, however, requires accurate reconstruction of the tissue volume from the 2D image stack. This task is not trivial due to the distortions that each individual tissue slice experiences while cutting and mounting the tissue on the glass slide. Performing registration for the whole tissue slices may be adversely affected by the deformed tissue regions. Consequently, regional registration is found to be more effective. In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust regional registration algorithm for whole slide images which incrementally focuses registration on the area around the region of interest. Results: Using mean similarity index as the metric, the proposed algorithm (mean $\pm$ std: $0.84 \pm 0.11$) followed by a fine registration algorithm ($0.86 \pm 0.08$) outperformed the state-of-the-art linear whole tissue registration algorithm ($0.74 \pm 0.19$) and the regional version of this algorithm ($0.81 \pm 0.15$). The proposed algorithm also outperforms the state-of-the-art nonlinear registration algorithm (original : $0.82 \pm 0.12$, regional : $0.77 \pm 0.22$) for whole slide images and a recently proposed patch-based registration algorithm (patch size 256: $0.79 \pm 0.16$ , patch size 512: $0.77 \pm 0.16$) for medical images. Availability: The C++ implementation code is available online at the github repository: https://github.com/MahsaPaknezhad/WSIRegistration</p></details> |  |
| **[Tissue Artifact Segmentation and Severity Analysis for Automated Diagnosis Using Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01386v3)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, pathological analysis and diagnosis are performed by manually eyeballing glass slide specimens under a microscope by an expert. The whole slide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide image enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to computational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are utilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data. Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity automatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity evaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The proposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of six fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This method outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for artifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the evaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the system was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical usability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis, 60 pages, 21 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Whole-Slide Image Focus Quality: Automatic Assessment and Impact on AI Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04619v2)** | 2020-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology enables remote access or consults and powerful image analysis algorithms. However, the slide digitization process can create artifacts such as out-of-focus (OOF). OOF is often only detected upon careful review, potentially causing rescanning and workflow delays. Although scan-time operator screening for whole-slide OOF is feasible, manual screening for OOF affecting only parts of a slide is impractical. We developed a convolutional neural network (ConvFocus) to exhaustively localize and quantify the severity of OOF regions on digitized slides. ConvFocus was developed using our refined semi-synthetic OOF data generation process, and evaluated using real whole-slide images spanning 3 different tissue types and 3 different stain types that were digitized by two different scanners. ConvFocus's predictions were compared with pathologist-annotated focus quality grades across 514 distinct regions representing 37,700 35x35 $μ$m image patches, and 21 digitized "z-stack" whole-slide images that contain known OOF patterns. When compared to pathologist-graded focus quality, ConvFocus achieved Spearman rank coefficients of 0.81 and 0.94 on two scanners, and reproduced the expected OOF patterns from z-stack scanning. We also evaluated the impact of OOF on the accuracy of a state-of-the-art metastatic breast cancer detector and saw a consistent decrease in performance with increasing OOF. Comprehensive whole-slide OOF categorization could enable rescans prior to pathologist review, potentially reducing the impact of digitization focus issues on the clinical workflow. We show that the algorithm trained on our semi-synthetic OOF data generalizes well to real OOF regions across tissue types, stains, and scanners. Finally, quantitative OOF maps can flag regions that might otherwise be misclassified by image analysis algorithms, preventing OOF-induced errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic labeling of molecular biomarkers of whole slide immunohistochemistry images using fully convolutional networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09420v1)** | 2017-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of quantifying biomarkers in multi-stained tissues, based on color and spatial information. A deep learning based method that can automatically localize and quantify the cells expressing biomarker(s) in a whole slide image is proposed. The deep learning network is a fully convolutional network (FCN) whose input is the true RGB color image of a tissue and output is a map of the different biomarkers. The FCN relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies each cell separately according to the biomarker it expresses. In this study, images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides were collected and used. More than 4,500 RGB images of cells were manually labeled based on the expressing biomarkers. The labeled cell images were used to train the CNN (obtaining an accuracy of 92% in a test set). The trained CNN is then extended to an FCN that generates a map of all biomarkers in the whole slide image acquired by the scanner (instead of classifying every cell image). To evaluate our method, we manually labeled all nuclei expressing different biomarkers in two whole slide images and used theses as the ground truth. Our proposed method for immunohistochemical analysis compares well with the manual labeling by humans (average F-score of 0.96).</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying regions of interest in whole slide images of renal cell carcinoma](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07313v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological images contain a huge amount of information, which can make diagnosis an extremely timeconsuming and tedious task. In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clustered Patch Embeddings for Permutation-Invariant Classification of Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08936v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is a cornerstone of digital pathology, offering detailed insights critical for diagnosis and research. Yet, the gigapixel size of WSIs imposes significant computational challenges, limiting their practical utility. Our novel approach addresses these challenges by leveraging various encoders for intelligent data reduction and employing a different classification model to ensure robust, permutation-invariant representations of WSIs. A key innovation of our method is the ability to distill the complex information of an entire WSI into a single vector, effectively capturing the essential features needed for accurate analysis. This approach significantly enhances the computational efficiency of WSI analysis, enabling more accurate pathological assessments without the need for extensive computational resources. This breakthrough equips us with the capability to effectively address the challenges posed by large image resolutions in whole-slide imaging, paving the way for more scalable and effective utilization of WSIs in medical diagnostics and research, marking a significant advancement in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.08530</p></details> |
| **[Improving Quality Control of Whole Slide Images by Explicit Artifact Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11538v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of artifacts in whole slide image acquisition, prevalent in both clinical workflows and research-oriented settings, necessitates human intervention and re-scanning. Overcoming this challenge requires developing quality control algorithms, that are hindered by the limited availability of relevant annotated data in histopathology. The manual annotation of ground-truth for artifact detection methods is expensive and time-consuming. This work addresses the issue by proposing a method dedicated to augmenting whole slide images with artifacts. The tool seamlessly generates and blends artifacts from an external library to a given histopathology dataset. The augmented datasets are then utilized to train artifact classification methods. The evaluation shows their usefulness in classification of the artifacts, where they show an improvement from 0.10 to 0.01 AUROC depending on the artifact type. The framework, model, weights, and ground-truth annotations are freely released to facilitate open science and reproducible research.</p></details> |  |
| **[WSI-VQA: Interpreting Whole Slide Images by Generative Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05603v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide imaging is routinely adopted for carcinoma diagnosis and prognosis. Abundant experience is required for pathologists to achieve accurate and reliable diagnostic results of whole slide images (WSI). The huge size and heterogeneous features of WSIs make the workflow of pathological reading extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (WSI-VQA) to interpret WSIs by generative visual question answering. WSI-VQA shows universality by reframing various kinds of slide-level tasks in a question-answering pattern, in which pathologists can achieve immunohistochemical grading, survival prediction, and tumor subtyping following human-machine interaction. Furthermore, we establish a WSI-VQA dataset which contains 8672 slide-level question-answering pairs with 977 WSIs. Besides the ability to deal with different slide-level tasks, our generative model which is named Wsi2Text Transformer (W2T) outperforms existing discriminative models in medical correctness, which reveals the potential of our model to be applied in the clinical scenario. Additionally, we also visualize the co-attention mapping between word embeddings and WSIs as an intuitive explanation for diagnostic results. The dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/cpystan/WSI-VQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Data Efficient and Weakly Supervised Computational Pathology on Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09666v2)** | 2020-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly emerging field of computational pathology has the potential to enable objective diagnosis, therapeutic response prediction and identification of new morphological features of clinical relevance. However, deep learning-based computational pathology approaches either require manual annotation of gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in fully-supervised settings or thousands of WSIs with slide-level labels in a weakly-supervised setting. Moreover, whole slide level computational pathology methods also suffer from domain adaptation and interpretability issues. These challenges have prevented the broad adaptation of computational pathology for clinical and research purposes. Here we present CLAM - Clustering-constrained attention multiple instance learning, an easy-to-use, high-throughput, and interpretable WSI-level processing and learning method that only requires slide-level labels while being data efficient, adaptable and capable of handling multi-class subtyping problems. CLAM is a deep-learning-based weakly-supervised method that uses attention-based learning to automatically identify sub-regions of high diagnostic value in order to accurately classify the whole slide, while also utilizing instance-level clustering over the representative regions identified to constrain and refine the feature space. In three separate analyses, we demonstrate the data efficiency and adaptability of CLAM and its superior performance over standard weakly-supervised classification. We demonstrate that CLAM models are interpretable and can be used to identify well-known and new morphological features. We further show that models trained using CLAM are adaptable to independent test cohorts, cell phone microscopy images, and biopsies. CLAM is a general-purpose and adaptable method that can be used for a variety of different computational pathology tasks in both clinical and research settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedWSIDD: Federated Whole Slide Image Classification via Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15365v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Automatic Multi-Stain Registration of Whole Slide Images in Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14292v1)** | 2022-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint analysis of multiple biomarker images and tissue morphology is important for disease diagnosis, treatment planning and drug development. It requires cross-staining comparison among Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of immuno-histochemical and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) microscopic slides. However, automatic, and fast cross-staining alignment of enormous gigapixel WSIs at single-cell precision is challenging. In addition to morphological deformations introduced during slide preparation, there are large variations in cell appearance and tissue morphology across different staining. In this paper, we propose a two-step automatic feature-based cross-staining WSI alignment to assist localization of even tiny metastatic foci in the assessment of lymph node. Image pairs were aligned allowing for translation, rotation, and scaling. The registration was performed automatically by first detecting landmarks in both images, using the scale-invariant image transform (SIFT), followed by the fast sample consensus (FSC) protocol for finding point correspondences and finally aligned the images. The Registration results were evaluated using both visual and quantitative criteria using the Jaccard index.

Usually, histopathology tissue slides from different institutions show heterogeneous appearances because of different tissue preparation and staining procedures, thus the predictable model learned from one domain may not be applicable to a new domain directly. Here we propose to adopt unsupervised domain adaptation to transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained from the source domain to the target domain without requiring labeling of images at the target domain. The adaptation is achieved through adversarial training to find an invariant feature space along with the proposed Siamese architecture on the target domain to add a regularization that is appropriate for the whole-slide images. We validate the method on two prostate cancer datasets and obtain significant classification improvement of Gleason scores as compared with the baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2018</p></details> |

With sWSI, most mainstream smartphone connected to a optical eyepiece of any manually controlled microscope can be automatically controlled to capture sequences of mega-pixel fields of views that are synthesized into giga-pixel virtual slides. Remote servers carry out the majority of computation asynchronously to support clients running at satisfying frame rates without sacrificing image quality nor robustness. A typical 15x15mm sample can be digitized in 30 seconds with 4X or in 3 minutes with 10X object magnification, costing under $1. The virtual slide quality is considered comparable to existing high-end scanners thus satisfying for clinical usage by surveyed pathologies. The scan procedure with features such as supporting magnification up to 100x, recoding z-stacks, specimen-type-neutral and giving real-time feedback, is deemed work-flow-friendly and reliable.</p></details> |  |

Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |

It allows one to perform the preprocessing, initial alignment, and nonrigid registration of WSIs acquired using multiple stains (e.g. hematoxylin \& eosin, immunochemistry). The framework implements several state-of-the-art registration algorithms and provides an interface to operate on arbitrary resolution of the WSIs (up to 200k x 200k).

A projected increase in skin cancer incidents and a dearth of dermatopathologists have emphasized the need for computational pathology (CPATH) systems. CPATH systems with deep learning (DL) models have the potential to identify the presence of melanoma by exploiting underlying morphological and cellular features. This paper proposes a DL method to detect melanoma and distinguish between normal skin and benign/malignant melanocytic lesions in Whole Slide Images (WSI). Our method detects lesions with high accuracy and localizes them on a WSI to identify potential regions of interest for pathologists. Interestingly, our DL method relies on using a single CNN network to create localization maps first and use them to perform slide-level predictions to determine patients who have melanoma. Our best model provides favorable patch-wise classification results with a 0.992 F1 score and 0.99 sensitivity on unseen data.

| **[Automated Whole Slide Imaging for Label-Free Histology using Photon Absorption Remote Sensing Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13736v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of histology relies heavily on antiquated tissue processing and staining techniques that limit the efficiency of pathologic diagnoses of cancer and other diseases. Current staining and advanced labeling methods are often destructive and mutually incompatible, requiring new tissue sections for each stain. This prolongs the diagnostic process and depletes valuable biopsy samples. In this study, we present an alternative label-free histology platform using the first transmission-mode Photon Absorption Remote Sensing microscope. Optimized for automated whole slide scanning of unstained tissue samples, the system provides slide images at magnifications up to 40x that are fully compatible with existing digital pathology tools. The scans capture high quality and high-resolution images with subcellular diagnostic detail. After imaging, samples remain suitable for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and other staining techniques. Scattering and absorption (radiative and non-radiative) contrasts are shown in whole slide images of malignant human breast and skin tissues samples. Clinically relevant features are highlighted, and close correspondence and analogous contrast is demonstrated with one-to-one gold standard H&E stained images. Our previously reported pix2pix virtual staining model is applied to an entire whole slide image, showcasing the potential of this approach in whole slide label-free H&E emulation. This work is a critical advance for integrating label-free optical methods into standard histopathology workflows, both enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and broadening the number of stains that can be applied while preserving valuable tissue samples.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Deep-Learning for Classification of Colorectal Polyps on Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01550v2)** | 2017-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients. This characterization is time-intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from significant inter-observer and intra-observer variability. In this work, we built an automatic image-understanding method that can accurately classify different types of colorectal polyps in whole-slide histology images to help pathologists with histopathological characterization and diagnosis of colorectal polyps. The proposed image-understanding method is based on deep-learning techniques, which rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and have shown state-of-the-art results for various image analysis tasks. Our image-understanding method covers all five polyp types (hyperplastic polyp, sessile serrated polyp, traditional serrated adenoma, tubular adenoma, and tubulovillous/villous adenoma) that are included in the US multi-society task force guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment and surveillance, and encompasses the most common occurrences of colorectal polyps. Our evaluation on 239 independent test samples shows our proposed method can identify the types of colorectal polyps in whole-slide images with a high efficacy (accuracy: 93.0%, precision: 89.7%, recall: 88.3%, F1 score: 88.8%). The presented method in this paper can reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps, and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations.</p></details> |  |

However, in order to obtain good performance, these research achievements rely on hundreds of well-annotated WSIs. In this study, we tackle the tumor localization and detection problem under the setting of few labeled whole slide images and introduce a patch-based analysis pipeline based on the latest reverse knowledge distillation architecture. To address the extremely unbalanced normal and tumorous samples in training sample collection, we applied the focal loss formula to the representation similarity metric for model optimization. Compared with prior arts, our method achieves similar performance by less than ten percent of training samples on the public Camelyon16 dataset. In addition, this is the first work that show the great potential of the knowledge distillation models in computational histopathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, 1 appendix</p></details> |

However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cascaded Cross-Attention Networks for Data-Efficient Whole-Slide Image Classification Using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06963v1)** | 2023-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-Slide Imaging allows for the capturing and digitization of high-resolution images of histological specimen. An automated analysis of such images using deep learning models is therefore of high demand. The transformer architecture has been proposed as a possible candidate for effectively leveraging the high-resolution information. Here, the whole-slide image is partitioned into smaller image patches and feature tokens are extracted from these image patches. However, while the conventional transformer allows for a simultaneous processing of a large set of input tokens, the computational demand scales quadratically with the number of input tokens and thus quadratically with the number of image patches. To address this problem we propose a novel cascaded cross-attention network (CCAN) based on the cross-attention mechanism that scales linearly with the number of extracted patches. Our experiments demonstrate that this architecture is at least on-par with and even outperforms other attention-based state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets: On the use-case of lung cancer (TCGA NSCLC) our model reaches a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.970 $\pm$ 0.008 and on renal cancer (TCGA RCC) reaches a mean AUC of 0.985 $\pm$ 0.004. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is efficient in low-data regimes, making it a promising approach for analyzing whole-slide images in resource-limited settings. To foster research in this direction, we make our code publicly available on GitHub: XXX.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11761v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB).

| **[PATHS: A Hierarchical Transformer for Efficient Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18225v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) has seen significant research progress in recent years, with applications ranging across important diagnostic and prognostic tasks such as survival or cancer subtype prediction. Many state-of-the-art models process the entire slide - which may be as large as $150,000 \times 150,000$ pixels - as a bag of many patches, the size of which necessitates computationally cheap feature aggregation methods. However, a large proportion of these patches are uninformative, such as those containing only healthy or adipose tissue, adding significant noise and size to the bag. We propose Pathology Transformer with Hierarchical Selection (PATHS), a novel top-down method for hierarchical weakly supervised representation learning on slide-level tasks in computational pathology. PATHS is inspired by the cross-magnification manner in which a human pathologist examines a slide, recursively filtering patches at each magnification level to a small subset relevant to the diagnosis. Our method overcomes the complications of processing the entire slide, enabling quadratic self-attention and providing a simple interpretable measure of region importance. We apply PATHS to five datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and achieve superior performance on slide-level prediction tasks when compared to previous methods, despite processing only a small proportion of the slide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pathology Feature Extractors for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11772v5)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised whole slide image classification is a key task in computational pathology, which involves predicting a slide-level label from a set of image patches constituting the slide. Constructing models to solve this task involves multiple design choices, often made without robust empirical or conclusive theoretical justification. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of feature extractors to answer three critical questions: 1) Is stain normalisation still a necessary preprocessing step? 2) Which feature extractors are best for downstream slide-level classification? 3) How does magnification affect downstream performance? Our study constitutes the most comprehensive evaluation of publicly available pathology feature extractors to date, involving more than 10,000 training runs across 14 feature extractors, 9 tasks, 5 datasets, 3 downstream architectures, 2 levels of magnification, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings challenge existing assumptions: 1) We observe empirically, and by analysing the latent space, that skipping stain normalisation and image augmentations does not degrade performance, while significantly reducing memory and computational demands. 2) We develop a novel evaluation metric to compare relative downstream performance, and show that the choice of feature extractor is the most consequential factor for downstream performance. 3) We find that lower-magnification slides are sufficient for accurate slide-level classification. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level biomarker prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the conference version see: arXiv:2311.11772v4.

However, due to the large scale of WSIs and various sizes of the abnormal area, how to select informative regions and analyze them are quite challenging during the automatic diagnosis process. The multi-instance learning based on the most discriminative instances can be of great benefit for whole slide gastric image diagnosis. In this paper, we design a recalibrated multi-instance deep learning method (RMDL) to address this challenging problem. We first select the discriminative instances, and then utilize these instances to diagnose diseases based on the proposed RMDL approach. The designed RMDL network is capable of capturing instance-wise dependencies and recalibrating instance features according to the importance coefficient learned from the fused features. Furthermore, we build a large whole-slide gastric histopathology image dataset with detailed pixel-level annotations. Experimental results on the constructed gastric dataset demonstrate the significant improvement on the accuracy of our proposed framework compared with other state-of-the-art multi-instance learning methods. Moreover, our method is general and can be extended to other diagnosis tasks of different cancer types based on WSIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Analysis.

| **[Region-guided CycleGANs for Stain Transfer in Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12847v1)** | 2022-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In whole slide imaging, commonly used staining techniques based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains accentuate different aspects of the tissue landscape. In the case of detecting metastases, IHC provides a distinct readout that is readily interpretable by pathologists. IHC, however, is a more expensive approach and not available at all medical centers. Virtually generating IHC images from H&E using deep neural networks thus becomes an attractive alternative. Deep generative models such as CycleGANs learn a semantically-consistent mapping between two image domains, while emulating the textural properties of each domain. They are therefore a suitable choice for stain transfer applications. However, they remain fully unsupervised, and possess no mechanism for enforcing biological consistency in stain transfer. In this paper, we propose an extension to CycleGANs in the form of a region of interest discriminator. This allows the CycleGAN to learn from unpaired datasets where, in addition, there is a partial annotation of objects for which one wishes to enforce consistency. We present a use case on whole slide images, where an IHC stain provides an experimentally generated signal for metastatic cells. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over prior art in stain transfer on histopathology tiles over two datasets. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/jcboyd/miccai2022-roigan.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoration of marker occluded hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide histology images using generative adversarial networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06428v1)** | 2019-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is common for pathologists to annotate specific regions of the tissue, such as tumor, directly on the glass slide with markers. Although this practice was helpful prior to the advent of histology whole slide digitization, it often occludes important details which are increasingly relevant to immuno-oncology due to recent advancements in digital pathology imaging techniques. The current work uses a generative adversarial network with cycle loss to remove these annotations while still maintaining the underlying structure of the tissue by solving an image-to-image translation problem. We train our network on up to 300 whole slide images with marker inks and show that 70% of the corrected image patches are indistinguishable from originally uncontaminated image tissue to a human expert. This portion increases 97% when we replace the human expert with a deep residual network. We demonstrated the fidelity of the method to the original image by calculating the correlation between image gradient magnitudes. We observed a revival of up to 94,000 nuclei per slide in our dataset, the majority of which were located on tissue border.</p></details> |  |

Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date.

However, it is much more challenging than natural optical image segmentation due to the high-resolution of medical images and the corresponding huge computation cost. The sliding window is a commonly used technique for whole slide image (WSI) segmentation, however, for these methods based on the sliding window, the main drawback is lacking global contextual information for supervision. In this paper, we propose a dual-inputs attention network (denoted as DA-RefineNet) for WSI segmentation, where both local fine-grained information and global coarse information can be efficiently utilized. Sufficient comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results prove that the proposed method can achieve better performance on WSI segmentation compared to methods relying on single-input.</p></details> |  |

However, generating such detailed annotation is often costly, whereas the coarse annotations are relatively simpler to produce. Existing methods for refining coarse annotations often rely on extensive training samples or clean datasets, and fail to capture both intra-slide and inter-slide latent sematic patterns, limiting their precision. In this paper, we propose a prototype-guided approach. Specifically, we introduce a local-to-global approach to construct non-redundant representative prototypes by jointly modeling intra-slide local semantics and inter-slide contextual relationships. Then a prototype-guided pseudo-labeling module is proposed for refining coarse annotations. Finally, we employ dynamic data sampling and re-finetuning strategy to train a patch classifier. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets, covering lymph, liver, and colorectal cancers, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

As one of the most recent applications, deep models have also been used to extract molecular features from whole slide images. Although molecular tests carry rich information, they are often expensive, time-consuming, and require additional tissue to sample. In this paper, we propose tRNAsfomer, an attention-based topology that can learn both to predict the bulk RNA-seq from an image and represent the whole slide image of a glass slide simultaneously. The tRNAsfomer uses multiple instance learning to solve a weakly supervised problem while the pixel-level annotation is not available for an image. We conducted several experiments and achieved better performance and faster convergence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed tRNAsfomer can assist as a computational pathology tool to facilitate a new generation of search and classification methods by combining the tissue morphology and the molecular fingerprint of the biopsy samples.</p></details> |  |

While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages and 19 pages of supplemental material; 3 main tables, 3 main figures and 11 supplemental tables, 7 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Whole-slide imaging which is a method of scanning glass slides have been employed for diagnosis of HCC. Using high resolution Whole-slide images is infeasible for Convolutional Neural Network applications. Hence tiling the Whole-slide images is a common methodology for assigning Convolutional Neural Networks for classification and segmentation. Determination of the tile size affects the performance of the algorithms since small field of view can not capture the information on a larger scale and large field of view can not capture the information on a cellular scale. In this work, the effect of tile size on performance for classification problem is analysed. In addition, Multi Field of View CNN is assigned for taking advantage of the information provided by different tile sizes and Attention CNN is assigned for giving the capability of voting most contributing tile size. It is found that employing more than one tile size significantly increases the performance of the classification by 3.97% and both algorithms are found successful over the algorithm which uses only one tile size.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to need for heavy revise</p></details> |

Virtual staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) allows the automatic production of other useful IHC stains without the expensive physical staining process. However, current virtual WSI generation methods based on tile-wise processing often suffer from inconsistencies in content, texture, and color at tile boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to artifacts that compromise image quality and potentially hinder accurate clinical assessment and diagnoses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel consistent WSI synthesis network, CC-WSI-Net, that extends GAN models to produce seamless synthetic whole slide images. Our CC-WSI-Net integrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency across tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while ensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We validate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective detection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists. By generating high-quality synthetic WSIs, our method opens doors for advanced virtual staining techniques with broader applications in research and clinical care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Mamba for Efficient Whole Slide Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17457v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |

It is unclear, however, how the current WSI registration methods would perform on a real-world data set. AutomatiC Registration Of Breast cAncer Tissue (ACROBAT) challenge is held to verify the performance of the current WSI registration methods by using a new dataset that originates from routine diagnostics to assess real-world applicability. In this report, we present our solution for the ACROBAT challenge. We employ a two-step approach including rigid and non-rigid transforms. The experimental results show that the median 90th percentile is 1,250 um for the validation dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computer-aided Detection of Squamous Carcinoma of the Cervix in Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10959v1)** | 2019-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal: Squamous cell carcinoma of cervix is one of the most prevalent cancer worldwide in females. Traditionally, the most indispensable diagnosis of cervix squamous carcinoma is histopathological assessment which is achieved under microscope by pathologist. However, human evaluation of pathology slide is highly depending on the experience of pathologist, thus big inter- and intra-observer variability exists. Digital pathology, in combination with deep learning provides an opportunity to improve the objectivity and efficiency of histopathologic slide analysis. Methods: In this study, we obtained 800 haematoxylin and eosin stained slides from 300 patients suffered from cervix squamous carcinoma. Based on information from morphological heterogeneity in the tumor and its adjacent area, we established deep learning models using popular convolution neural network architectures (inception-v3, InceptionResnet-v2 and Resnet50). Then random forest was introduced to feature extractions and slide-based classification. Results: The overall performance of our proposed models on slide-based tumor discrimination were outstanding with an AUC scores > 0.94. While, location identifications of lesions in whole slide images were mediocre (FROC scores > 0.52) duo to the extreme complexity of tumor tissues. Conclusion: For the first time, our analysis workflow highlighted a quantitative visual-based slide analysis of cervix squamous carcinoma. Significance: This study demonstrates a pathway to assist pathologist and accelerate the diagnosis of patients by utilizing new computational approaches.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5figures |
| **[Trusted Multi-Scale Classification Framework for Whole Slide Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05290v1)** | 2022-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable efforts been made, the classification of gigapixels whole-slide image (WSI) is severely restrained from either the constrained computing resources for the whole slides, or limited utilizing of the knowledge from different scales. Moreover, most of the previous attempts lacked of the ability of uncertainty estimation. Generally, the pathologists often jointly analyze WSI from the different magnifications. If the pathologists are uncertain by using single magnification, then they will change the magnification repeatedly to discover various features of the tissues. Motivated by the diagnose process of the pathologists, in this paper, we propose a trusted multi-scale classification framework for the WSI. Leveraging the Vision Transformer as the backbone for multi branches, our framework can jointly classification modeling, estimating the uncertainty of each magnification of a microscope and integrate the evidence from different magnification. Moreover, to exploit discriminative patches from WSIs and reduce the requirement for computation resources, we propose a novel patch selection schema using attention rollout and non-maximum suppression. To empirically investigate the effectiveness of our approach, empirical experiments are conducted on our WSI classification tasks, using two benchmark databases. The obtained results suggest that the trusted framework can significantly improve the WSI classification performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Pipeline for Glomerulus Whole-Slide Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04782v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSI) glomerulus segmentation is essential for accurately diagnosing kidney diseases. In this work, we propose a general and practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs.

The previous representation learning methods followed the supervised learning paradigm. However, manual annotation for large-scale WSIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Hence, the self-supervised contrastive learning has recently attracted intensive attention. The present contrastive learning methods treat each sample as a single class, which suffers from class collision problems, especially in the domain of histopathology image analysis. In this paper, we proposed a novel contrastive representation learning framework named Lesion-Aware Contrastive Learning (LACL) for histopathology whole slide image analysis. We built a lesion queue based on the memory bank structure to store the representations of different classes of WSIs, which allowed the contrastive model to selectively define the negative pairs during the training. Moreover, We designed a queue refinement strategy to purify the representations stored in the lesion queue. The experimental results demonstrate that LACL achieves the best performance in histopathology image representation learning on different datasets, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under different WSI classification benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/junl21/lacl.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for MICCAI 2022</p></details> |
| **[DPsurv: Dual-Prototype Evidential Fusion for Uncertainty-Aware and Interpretable Whole-Slide Image Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00053v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Rapid Diagnosis of Whole Slide Pathological Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02850v1)** | 2022-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deep neural network is a research hotspot for histopathological image analysis, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis for pathologists or be used for disease screening. The whole slide pathological image can reach one gigapixel and contains abundant tissue feature information, which needs to be divided into a lot of patches in the training and inference stages. This will lead to a long convergence time and large memory consumption. Furthermore, well-annotated data sets are also in short supply in the field of digital pathology. Inspired by the pathologist's clinical diagnosis process, we propose a weakly supervised deep reinforcement learning framework, which can greatly reduce the time required for network inference. We use neural network to construct the search model and decision model of reinforcement learning agent respectively. The search model predicts the next action through the image features of different magnifications in the current field of view, and the decision model is used to return the predicted probability of the current field of view image. In addition, an expert-guided model is constructed by multi-instance learning, which not only provides rewards for search model, but also guides decision model learning by the knowledge distillation method. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve fast inference and accurate prediction of whole slide images without any pixel-level annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Residual Encoding with Slide-Level Contrastive Learning for End-to-End Whole Slide Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05034v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping, cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 3figures, published to ACM Digital Library</p></details> |
| **[FALFormer: Feature-aware Landmarks self-attention for Whole-slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07340v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slide-level classification for whole-slide images (WSIs) has been widely recognized as a crucial problem in digital and computational pathology. Current approaches commonly consider WSIs as a bag of cropped patches and process them via multiple instance learning due to the large number of patches, which cannot fully explore the relationship among patches; in other words, the global information cannot be fully incorporated into decision making. Herein, we propose an efficient and effective slide-level classification model, named as FALFormer, that can process a WSI as a whole so as to fully exploit the relationship among the entire patches and to improve the classification performance. FALFormer is built based upon Transformers and self-attention mechanism. To lessen the computational burden of the original self-attention mechanism and to process the entire patches together in a WSI, FALFormer employs Nyström self-attention which approximates the computation by using a smaller number of tokens or landmarks. For effective learning, FALFormer introduces feature-aware landmarks to enhance the representation power of the landmarks and the quality of the approximation. We systematically evaluate the performance of FALFormer using two public datasets, including CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA. The experimental results demonstrate that FALFormer achieves superior performance on both datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for the slide-level classification. This suggests that FALFormer can facilitate an accurate and precise analysis of WSIs, potentially leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis on WSIs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

In the proposed work, we address the problem of whole-slide blood cell segmentation using the semantic segmentation approach. We design a novel convolutional encoder-decoder framework along with VGG-16 as the pixel-level feature extraction model. -e proposed framework comprises 3 main steps: First, all the original images along with manually generated ground truth masks of each blood cell type are passed through the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, pixel-level labeling, RGB to grayscale conversion of masked image and pixel fusing, and unity mask generation are performed. After that, VGG16 is loaded into the system, which acts as a pretrained pixel-level feature extraction model. In the third step, the training process is initiated on the proposed model. We have evaluated our network performance on three evaluation metrics. We obtained outstanding results with respect to classwise, as well as global and mean accuracies. Our system achieved classwise accuracies of 97.45%, 93.34%, and 85.11% for RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, respectively, while global and mean accuracies remain 97.18% and 91.96%, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterization of Posidonia Oceanica Seagrass Aerenchyma through Whole Slide Imaging: A Pilot Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03044v2)** | 2019-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Characterizing the tissue morphology and anatomy of seagrasses is essential to predicting their acoustic behavior. In this pilot study, we use histology techniques and whole slide imaging (WSI) to describe the composition and topology of the aerenchyma of an entire leaf blade in an automatic way combining the advantages of X-ray microtomography and optical microscopy. Paraffin blocks are prepared in such a way that microtome slices contain an arbitrarily large number of cross sections distributed along the full length of a blade. The sample organization in the paraffin block coupled with whole slide image analysis allows high throughput data extraction and an exhaustive characterization along the whole blade length. The core of the work are image processing algorithms that can identify cells and air lacunae (or void) from fiber strand, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. A set of specific features is developed to adequately describe the convexity of cells and voids where standard descriptors fail. The features scrutinize the local curvature of the object borders to allow an accurate discrimination between void and cell through machine learning. The algorithm allows to reconstruct the cells and cell membrane features that are relevant to tissue density, compressibility and rigidity. Size distribution of the different cell types and gas spaces, total biomass and total void volume fraction are then extracted from the high resolution slices to provide a complete characterization of the tissue along the leave from its base to the apex.</p></details> |  |

The model is trained to classify patches extracted from slides. This leads the training to be made under noisy labeled data. We solve the problem with two complementary strategies. First, the patches are sampled online using the model's knowledge by focusing on regions where the model's confidence is higher. Second, we propose an extension of the KL divergence that is robust to noisy labels. Our preliminary experiment on CAMELYON 16 data set show promising results. The model can successfully segment tumor areas with strong morphological consistency.</p></details> | Performance update |

However, large histology slides with numerous microscopic fields pose challenges for visual search. To aid pathologists, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems offer visual assistance in efficiently examining WSIs and identifying diagnostically relevant regions. This paper presents a novel histopathological image analysis method employing Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on Capsule Networks, the first such application. The proposed model is evaluated using the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP) dataset and its performance is compared with other histopathological semantic segmentation methodologies. The findings underscore the potential of Capsule Networks in enhancing the precision and efficiency of histopathological image analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and the mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) metric.</p></details> |  |

The deep-learning methods used in computational pathology may help us to reduce costs and increase the speed and accuracy of cancer diagnosis. We started with the UNC Melanocytic Tumor Dataset cohort that contains 160 hematoxylin and eosin whole-slide images of primary melanomas (86) and nevi (74). We randomly assigned 80% (134) as a training set and built an in-house deep-learning method to allow for classification, at the slide level, of nevi and melanomas. The proposed method performed well on the other 20% (26) test dataset; the accuracy of the slide classification task was 92.3% and our model also performed well in terms of predicting the region of interest annotated by the pathologists, showing excellent performance of our model on melanocytic skin tumors. Even though we tested the experiments on the skin tumor dataset, our work could also be extended to other medical image detection problems to benefit the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of different tumors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures, NeurIPS 2022 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Classifying Whole Slide Images: What Matters?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03279v1)** | 2023-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently there have been many algorithms proposed for the classification of very high resolution whole slide images (WSIs). These new algorithms are mostly focused on finding novel ways to combine the information from small local patches extracted from the slide, with an emphasis on effectively aggregating more global information for the final predictor. In this paper we thoroughly explore different key design choices for WSI classification algorithms to investigate what matters most for achieving high accuracy. Surprisingly, we found that capturing global context information does not necessarily mean better performance. A model that captures the most global information consistently performs worse than a model that captures less global information. In addition, a very simple multi-instance learning method that captures no global information performs almost as well as models that capture a lot of global information. These results suggest that the most important features for effective WSI classification are captured at the local small patch level, where cell and tissue micro-environment detail is most pronounced. Another surprising finding was that unsupervised pre-training on a larger set of 33 cancers gives significantly worse performance compared to pre-training on a smaller dataset of 7 cancers (including the target cancer). We posit that pre-training on a smaller, more focused dataset allows the feature extractor to make better use of the limited feature space to better discriminate between subtle differences in the input patch.</p></details> |  |

In order to compare and correlate patterns of different proteins, the images have to be registered with high accuracy. The problem we want to solve is registration of gigapixel whole slide images (WSI). This presents 3 challenges: (i) Images are very large; (ii) Thin sections result in artifacts that make global affine registration prone to very large local errors; (iii) Local affine registration is required to preserve correct tissue morphology (local size, shape and texture). In our approach we compare WSI registration based on automatic and manual feature selection on either the full image or natural sub-regions (as opposed to square tiles). Working with natural sub-regions, in an interactive tool makes it possible to exclude regions containing scientifically irrelevant information. We also present a new way to visualize local registration quality by a Registration Confidence Map (RCM). With this method, intra-tumor heterogeneity and charateristics of the tumor microenvironment can be observed and quantified.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI2018 - Computational Pathology and Ophthalmic Medical Image Analysis - COMPAY</p></details> |

Analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is challenging because they are very large, i.e., of Giga-pixel resolution. Identifying Regions of Interest (ROIs) is the first step for pathologists to analyse further the regions of diagnostic interest for cancer detection and other anomalies. In this paper, we investigate the use of RCNN, which is a deep machine learning technique, for detecting such ROIs only using a small number of labelled WSIs for training. For experimentation, we used real WSIs from a public hospital pathology service in Western Australia. We used 60 WSIs for training the RCNN model and another 12 WSIs for testing. The model was further tested on a new set of unseen WSIs. The results show that RCNN can be effectively used for ROI detection from WSIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the 27th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP 2020) and will be published in the Springer CCIS Series</p></details> |
| **[RLogist: Fast Observation Strategy on Whole-slide Images with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01737v2)** | 2022-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSI) in computational pathology have high resolution with gigapixel size, but are generally with sparse regions of interest, which leads to weak diagnostic relevance and data inefficiency for each area in the slide. Most of the existing methods rely on a multiple instance learning framework that requires densely sampling local patches at high magnification. The limitation is evident in the application stage as the heavy computation for extracting patch-level features is inevitable. In this paper, we develop RLogist, a benchmarking deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for fast observation strategy on WSIs. Imitating the diagnostic logic of human pathologists, our RL agent learns how to find regions of observation value and obtain representative features across multiple resolution levels, without having to analyze each part of the WSI at the high magnification. We benchmark our method on two whole-slide level classification tasks, including detection of metastases in WSIs of lymph node sections, and subtyping of lung cancer. Experimental results demonstrate that RLogist achieves competitive classification performance compared to typical multiple instance learning algorithms, while having a significantly short observation path. In addition, the observation path given by RLogist provides good decision-making interpretability, and its ability of reading path navigation can potentially be used by pathologists for educational/assistive purposes.

However, such pathology measurement is manually made in most clinical practices, subject to severe reader variability due to large sampling bias and poor reproducibility. Although some computerized automated methods are developed to quantify the steatosis regions, they present limited analysis capacity for high resolution whole-slide microscopy images and accurate overlapped steatosis division. In this paper, we propose a method that extracts an individual whole tissue piece at high resolution with minimum background area by estimating tissue bounding box and rotation angle. This is followed by the segmentation and segregation of steatosis regions with high curvature point detection and an ellipse fitting quality assessment method. We validate our method with isolated and overlapped steatosis regions in liver tissue images of 11 patients. The experimental results suggest that our method is promising for enhanced support of steatosis quantization during the pathology review for liver disease treatment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anonymization of Whole Slide Images in Histopathology for Research and Education](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06103v1)** | 2024-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: The exchange of health-related data is subject to regional laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, resulting in non-trivial challenges for researchers and educators when working with these data. In pathology, the digitization of diagnostic tissue samples inevitably generates identifying data that can consist of sensitive but also acquisition-related information stored in vendor-specific file formats. Distribution and off-clinical use of these Whole Slide Images (WSI) is usually done in these formats, as an industry-wide standardization such as DICOM is yet only tentatively adopted and slide scanner vendors currently do not provide anonymization functionality. Methods: We developed a guideline for the proper handling of histopathological image data particularly for research and education with regard to the GDPR. In this context, we evaluated existing anonymization methods and examined proprietary format specifications to identify all sensitive information for the most common WSI formats. This work results in a software library that enables GDPR-compliant anonymization of WSIs while preserving the native formats. Results: Based on the analysis of proprietary formats, all occurrences of sensitive information were identified for file formats frequently used in clinical routine, and finally, an open-source programming library with an executable CLI-tool and wrappers for different programming languages was developed. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that there is no straightforward software solution to anonymize WSIs in a GDPR-compliant way while maintaining the data format. We closed this gap with our extensible open-source library that works instantaneously and offline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid Whole Slide Imaging via Learning-based Two-shot Virtual Autofocusing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06630v1)** | 2020-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide imaging (WSI) is an emerging technology for digital pathology. The process of autofocusing is the main influence of the performance of WSI. Traditional autofocusing methods either are time-consuming due to repetitive mechanical motions, or require additional hardware and thus are not compatible to current WSI systems. In this paper, we propose the concept of \textit{virtual autofocusing}, which does not rely on mechanical adjustment to conduct refocusing but instead recovers in-focus images in an offline learning-based manner. With the initial focal position, we only perform two-shot imaging, in contrast traditional methods commonly need to conduct as many as 21 times image shooting in each tile scanning. Considering that the two captured out-of-focus images retain pieces of partial information about the underlying in-focus image, we propose a U-Net-inspired deep neural network based approach for fusing them into a recovered in-focus image. The proposed scheme is fast in tissue slides scanning, enabling a high-throughput generation of digital pathology images. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves satisfactory refocusing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViLa-MIL: Dual-scale Vision-Language Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08391v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and hierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> |

However, achieving such results requires training with numerous manual voxel annotations. This requirement presents a challenge for whole-body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, where lesions are scattered throughout the body. To tackle this problem, we introduce SW-FastEdit - an interactive segmentation framework that accelerates the labeling by utilizing only a few user clicks instead of voxelwise annotations. While prior interactive models crop or resize PET volumes due to memory constraints, we use the complete volume with our sliding window-based interactive scheme. Our model outperforms existing non-sliding window interactive models on the AutoPET dataset and generalizes to the previously unseen HECKTOR dataset. A user study revealed that annotators achieve high-quality predictions with only 10 click iterations and a low perceived NASA-TLX workload.

Limited by the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, current research primarily focuses on representation learning with slide-level labels, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, given the diversity of lesion types and the complex relationships between each other, these techniques still deserve further exploration in addressing advanced pathology tasks. To this end, we introduce the concept of hierarchical pathological image classification and propose a representation learning called PathTree. PathTree considers the multi-classification of diseases as a binary tree structure. Each category is represented as a professional pathological text description, which messages information with a tree-like encoder. The interactive text features are then used to guide the aggregation of hierarchical multiple representations. PathTree uses slide-text similarity to obtain probability scores and introduces two extra tree specific losses to further constrain the association between texts and slides. Through extensive experiments on three challenging hierarchical classification datasets: in-house cryosectioned lung tissue lesion identification, public prostate cancer grade assessment, and public breast cancer subtyping, our proposed PathTree is consistently competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new perspective on the deep learning-assisted solution for more complex WSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

Precise diagnostic criteria for a renal biopsy diagnosis of TMA are missing. As a first step towards a machine learning- and computer vision-based analysis of wholes slide images from renal biopsies, we trained a segmentation model for the decisive diagnostic kidney tissue compartments artery, arteriole, glomerulus on a set of whole slide images from renal biopsies with TMAs and Mimickers (distinct diseases with a similar nephropathological appearance as TMA like severe benign nephrosclerosis, various vasculitides, Bevacizumab-plug glomerulopathy, arteriolar light chain deposition disease). Our segmentation model combines a U-Net-based tissue detection with a Shifted windows-transformer architecture to reach excellent segmentation results for even the most severely altered glomeruli, arterioles and arteries, even on unseen staining domains from a different nephropathology lab. With accurate automatic segmentation of the decisive renal biopsy compartments in human renal vasculopathies, we have laid the foundation for large-scale compartment-specific machine learning and computer vision analysis of renal biopsy repositories with TMAs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Recent advances in the pathological foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs. However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

In particular, our method adds a training constraint to the supervised contrastive learning approach to achieve domain adaptation and improve inter-class separability. Experiments performed on domain adaptation and classification of whole-slide images of six skin cancer subtypes from two centers demonstrate the method's usefulness.

Tumor region detection, subtype and grade classification are the fundamental diagnostic indicators for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in whole-slide images (WSIs). However, pathological diagnosis is subjective, differences in observation and diagnosis between pathologists is common in hospitals with inadequate diagnostic capacity. The main challenge for developing deep learning based RCC diagnostic system is the lack of large-scale datasets with precise annotations. In this work, we proposed a deep learning-based framework for analyzing histopathological images of patients with renal cell carcinoma, which has the potential to achieve pathologist-level accuracy in diagnosis. A deep convolutional neural network (InceptionV3) was trained on the high-quality annotated dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-slide histopathological image for accurate tumor area detection, classification of RCC subtypes, and ISUP grades classification of clear cell carcinoma subtypes. These results suggest that our framework can help pathologists in the detection of cancer region and classification of subtypes and grades, which could be applied to any cancer type, providing auxiliary diagnosis and promoting clinical consensus.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2021 accepted, 9 pages including reference, 3 figures and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Tissue Cross-Section and Pen Marking Segmentation in Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13511v1)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue segmentation is a routine preprocessing step to reduce the computational cost of whole slide image (WSI) analysis by excluding background regions. Traditional image processing techniques are commonly used for tissue segmentation, but often require manual adjustments to parameter values for atypical cases, fail to exclude all slide and scanning artifacts from the background, and are unable to segment adipose tissue. Pen marking artifacts in particular can be a potential source of bias for subsequent analyses if not removed. In addition, several applications require the separation of individual cross-sections, which can be challenging due to tissue fragmentation and adjacent positioning. To address these problems, we develop a convolutional neural network for tissue and pen marking segmentation using a dataset of 200 H&E stained WSIs. For separating tissue cross-sections, we propose a novel post-processing method based on clustering predicted centroid locations of the cross-sections in a 2D histogram. On an independent test set, the model achieved a mean Dice score of 0.981$\pm$0.033 for tissue segmentation and a mean Dice score of 0.912$\pm$0.090 for pen marking segmentation. The mean absolute difference between the number of annotated and separated cross-sections was 0.075$\pm$0.350. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately segment H&E stained tissue cross-sections and pen markings in WSIs while being robust to many common slide and scanning artifacts. The model with trained model parameters and post-processing method are made publicly available as a Python package called SlideSegmenter.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

However, the direct application of conventional image processing algorithms to WSI faces certain obstacles because of WSIs' distinct property: the super-high resolution. The performance of most WSI-related tasks relies on the efficacy of the backbone which extracts WSI patch feature representations. Hence, we proposed BROW, a foundation model for extracting better feature representations for WSIs, which can be conveniently adapted to downstream tasks without or with slight fine-tuning. The model takes transformer architecture, pretrained using self-distillation framework. To improve model's robustness, techniques such as patch shuffling have been employed. Additionally, the model leverages the unique properties of WSIs, utilizing WSI's multi-scale pyramid to incorporate an additional global view, thereby further enhancing its performance. We used both private and public data to make up a large pretraining dataset, containing more than 11000 slides, over 180M extracted patches, encompassing WSIs related to various organs and tissues. To assess the effectiveness of \ourmodel, we run a wide range of downstream tasks, including slide-level subtyping, patch-level classification and nuclei instance segmentation. The results confirmed the efficacy, robustness and good generalization ability of the proposed model. This substantiates its potential as foundation model for WSI feature extraction and highlights promising prospects for its application in WSI processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages including reference part, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging image captions for selective whole slide image annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06363v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring annotations for whole slide images (WSIs)-based deep learning tasks, such as creating tissue segmentation masks or detecting mitotic figures, is a laborious process due to the extensive image size and the significant manual work involved in the annotation. This paper focuses on identifying and annotating specific image regions that optimize model training, given a limited annotation budget. While random sampling helps capture data variance by collecting annotation regions throughout the WSIs, insufficient data curation may result in an inadequate representation of minority classes. Recent studies proposed diversity sampling to select a set of regions that maximally represent unique characteristics of the WSIs. This is done by pretraining on unlabeled data through self-supervised learning and then clustering all regions in the latent space. However, establishing the optimal number of clusters can be difficult and not all clusters are task-relevant. This paper presents prototype sampling, a new method for annotation region selection. It discovers regions exhibiting typical characteristics of each task-specific class. The process entails recognizing class prototypes from extensive histopathology image-caption databases and detecting unlabeled image regions that resemble these prototypes. Our results show that prototype sampling is more effective than random and diversity sampling in identifying annotation regions with valuable training information, resulting in improved model performance in semantic segmentation and mitotic figure detection tasks.

| **[CNN Cascades for Segmenting Whole Slide Images of the Kidney](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00251v1)** | 2020-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the increasing availability of whole slide scanners facilitating digitization of histopathological tissue, there is a strong demand for the development of computer based image analysis systems. In this work, the focus is on the segmentation of the glomeruli constituting a highly relevant structure in renal histopathology, which has not been investigated before in combination with CNNs. We propose two different CNN cascades for segmentation applications with sparse objects. These approaches are applied to the problem of glomerulus segmentation and compared with conventional fully-convolutional networks. Overall, with the best performing cascade approach, single CNNs are outperformed and a pixel-level Dice similarity coefficient of 0.90 is obtained. Combined with qualitative and further object-level analyses the obtained results are assessed as excellent also compared to recent approaches. In conclusion, we can state that especially one of the proposed cascade networks proved to be a highly powerful tool for segmenting the renal glomeruli providing best segmentation accuracies and also keeping the computing time at a low level.</p></details> |  |

Current research into improving compression algorithms is focused on methods allowing lower compression rates for Regions of Interest (ROI-based approaches). Neural networks are great at extracting meaningful semantic representations from images, therefore are able to select the regions to be considered of interest for the compression process. In this work, we focus on the compression of whole slide histopathology images. The objective is to build an ensemble of neural networks that enables a compressive autoencoder in a supervised fashion to retain a denser and more meaningful representation of the input histology images. Our proposed system is a simple and novel method to supervise compressive neural networks. We test the compressed images using transfer learning-based classifiers and show that they provide promising accuracy and classification performance.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing MIL methods primarily focus on improving the feature extractor and aggregator. However, one deficiency of these methods is that the bag contextual prior may trick the model into capturing spurious correlations between bags and labels. This deficiency is a confounder that limits the performance of existing MIL methods. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning (IBMIL), to achieve deconfounded bag-level prediction. Unlike traditional likelihood-based strategies, the proposed scheme is based on the backdoor adjustment to achieve the interventional training, thus is capable of suppressing the bias caused by the bag contextual prior. Note that the principle of IBMIL is orthogonal to existing bag MIL methods. Therefore, IBMIL is able to bring consistent performance boosting to existing schemes, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

To study tumour microenvironment (TME) with the context of various protein biomarkers and cell sub-types, analysis and registration of features using multi-stained WSIs is often required. Multi-stained WSI pairs normally suffer from rigid and non-rigid deformities in addition to slide artefacts and control tissue which present challenges at precise registration. Traditional registration methods mainly focus on global rigid/non-rigid registration but struggle with aligning slides with complex tissue deformations at the nuclei level. However, nuclei level non-rigid registration is essential for downstream tasks such as cell sub-type analysis in the context of protein biomarker signatures. This paper focuses on local level non-rigid registration using a nuclei-location based point set registration approach for aligning multi-stained WSIs. We exploit the spatial distribution of nuclei that is prominent and consistent (to a large level) across different stains to establish a spatial correspondence. We evaluate our approach using the HYRECO dataset consisting of 54 re-stained images of H\&E and PHH3 image pairs. The approach can be extended to other IHC and IF stained WSIs considering a good nuclei detection algorithm is accessible. The performance of the model is tested against established registration algorithms and is shown to outperform the model for nuclei level registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to Medical Image Understanding and Analysis Conference 2024</p></details> |

However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> | IEEE Access (2025) |
| **[Finding Regions of Interest in Whole Slide Images Using Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01446v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSI), obtained by high-resolution digital scanning of microscope slides at multiple scales, are the cornerstone of modern Digital Pathology. However, they represent a particular challenge to AI-based/AI-mediated analysis because pathology labeling is typically done at slide-level, instead of tile-level. It is not just that medical diagnostics is recorded at the specimen level, the detection of oncogene mutation is also experimentally obtained, and recorded by initiatives like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), at the slide level. This configures a dual challenge: a) accurately predicting the overall cancer phenotype and b) finding out what cellular morphologies are associated with it at the tile level. To address these challenges, a weakly supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach was explored for two prevalent cancer types, Invasive Breast Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-LUSC). This approach was explored for tumor detection at low magnification levels and TP53 mutations at various levels. Our results show that a novel additive implementation of MIL matched the performance of reference implementation (AUC 0.96), and was only slightly outperformed by Attention MIL (AUC 0.97). More interestingly from the perspective of the molecular pathologist, these different AI architectures identify distinct sensitivities to morphological features (through the detection of Regions of Interest, RoI) at different amplification levels. Tellingly, TP53 mutation was most sensitive to features at the higher applications where cellular morphology is resolved.</p></details> |  |

Naturally a question comes to us that whether the combination of pixel-level (e.g., segmentation) and image level (e.g., classification) annotation can introduce further improvement. However in computational pathology this is a difficult task for this reason: High resolution of whole slide images makes it difficult to do end-to-end classification model training, which is challenging to research of weak or hybrid supervision learning in the past. To handle this problem, we propose a hybrid supervision learning framework for this kind of high resolution images with sufficient image-level coarse annotations and a few pixel-level fine labels. This framework, when applied in training patch model, can carefully make use of coarse image-level labels to refine generated pixel-level pseudo labels. Complete strategy is proposed to suppress pixel-level false positives and false negatives. A large hybrid annotated dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid supervision learning. By extracting pixel-level pseudo labels in initially image-level labeled samples, we achieve 5.2% higher specificity than purely training on existing labels while retaining 100% sensitivity, in the task of image-level classification to be positive or negative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in MICCAI2021</p></details> |

Especially in the field of mitosis detection, it is assumed that detection accuracy could significantly benefit from larger annotation databases that are currently however very troublesome to produce. Further, multiple independent (blind) expert labels are a big asset for such databases, yet there is currently no tool for this kind of annotation available. To ease this tedious process of expert annotation and grading, we introduce SlideRunner, an open source annotation and visualization tool for digital histopathology, developed in close cooperation with two pathologists.

Current approaches for nucleus detection in gigapixel WSIs utilize a sliding window methodology, which overlooks boarder contextual information (eg, tissue structure) and easily leads to inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, recent studies additionally crops a large Filed-of-View (FoV) region around each sliding window to extract contextual features. However, such methods substantially increases the inference latency. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient context-aware nucleus detection algorithm. Specifically, instead of leveraging large FoV regions, we aggregate contextual clues from off-the-shelf features of historically visited sliding windows. This design greatly reduces computational overhead. Moreover, compared to large FoV regions at a low magnification, the sliding window patches have higher magnification and provide finer-grained tissue details, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy. To further improve the efficiency, we propose a grid pooling technique to compress dense feature maps of each patch into a few contextual tokens. Finally, we craft OCELOT-seg, the first benchmark dedicated to context-aware nucleus instance segmentation.

This is particularly notable as patch-level processing introduces a considerable I/O load onto the computer system. However, this data management process could be further paralleled, given the typical independence of patch-level image processes across different patches. This paper details our endeavors in tackling this data access challenge by implementing the Adaptable IO System version 2 (ADIOS2). Our focus has been constructing and releasing a digital pathology-centric pipeline using ADIOS2, which facilitates streamlined data management across WSIs. Additionally, we've developed strategies aimed at curtailing data retrieval times. The performance evaluation encompasses two key scenarios: (1) a pure CPU-based image analysis scenario ("CPU scenario"), and (2) a GPU-based deep learning framework scenario ("GPU scenario"). Our findings reveal noteworthy outcomes. Under the CPU scenario, ADIOS2 showcases an impressive two-fold speed-up compared to the brute-force approach. In the GPU scenario, its performance stands on par with the cutting-edge GPU I/O acceleration framework, NVIDIA Magnum IO GPU Direct Storage (GDS). From what we know, this appears to be among the initial instances, if any, of utilizing ADIOS2 within the field of digital pathology.

In clinical settings, restricted access to pathology slides is inevitable due to patient privacy concerns and the prevalence of rare or emerging diseases. The emergence of the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification accommodates the significant challenge of the limited slide data and sparse slide-level labels for diagnosis. Prompt learning based on the pre-trained models (\eg, CLIP) appears to be a promising scheme for this setting; however, current research in this area is limited, and existing algorithms often focus solely on patch-level prompts or confine themselves to language prompts. This paper proposes a multi-instance prompt learning framework enhanced with pathology knowledge, \ie, integrating visual and textual prior knowledge into prompts at both patch and slide levels. The training process employs a combination of static and learnable prompts, effectively guiding the activation of pre-trained models and further facilitating the diagnosis of key pathology patterns. Lightweight Messenger (self-attention) and Summary (attention-pooling) layers are introduced to model relationships between patches and slides within the same patient data. Additionally, alignment-wise contrastive losses ensure the feature-level alignment between visual and textual learnable prompts for both patches and slides. Our method demonstrates superior performance in three challenging clinical tasks, significantly outperforming comparative few-shot methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

| **[Leveraging Unlabeled Whole-Slide-Images for Mitosis Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11677v1)** | 2018-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitosis count is an important biomarker for prognosis of various cancers. At present, pathologists typically perform manual counting on a few selected regions of interest in breast whole-slide-images (WSIs) of patient biopsies. This task is very time-consuming, tedious and subjective. Automated mitosis detection methods have made great advances in recent years. However, these methods require exhaustive labeling of a large number of selected regions of interest. This task is very expensive because expert pathologists are needed for reliable and accurate annotations. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised mitosis detection method which is designed to leverage a large number of unlabeled breast cancer WSIs. As a result, our method capitalizes on the growing number of digitized histology images, without relying on exhaustive annotations, subsequently improving mitosis detection. Our method first learns a mitosis detector from labeled data, uses this detector to mine additional mitosis samples from unlabeled WSIs, and then trains the final model using this larger and diverse set of mitosis samples. The use of unlabeled data improves F1-score by $\sim$5\% compared to our best performing fully-supervised model on the TUPAC validation set. Our submission (single model) to TUPAC challenge ranks highly on the leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.64.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI COMPAY 2018 Workshop</p></details> |

Inspired by how human experts perform diagnosis, our approach first identifies and classifies diagnostic image regions containing informative thyroid cells, which only comprise a tiny fraction of the entire image. These local estimates are then aggregated into a single prediction of thyroid malignancy. Several unique characteristics of thyroid cytopathology guide our deep-learning-based approach. While our method is closely related to multiple-instance learning, it deviates from these methods by using a supervised procedure to extract diagnostically relevant regions. Moreover, we propose to simultaneously predict thyroid malignancy, as well as a diagnostic score assigned by a human expert, which further allows us to devise an improved training strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to human experts, and demonstrate the potential of using the algorithm for screening and as an assistive tool for the improved diagnosis of indeterminate cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple and Efficient Confidence Score for Grading Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04604v1)** | 2023-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grading precancerous lesions on whole slide images is a challenging task: the continuous space of morphological phenotypes makes clear-cut decisions between different grades often difficult, leading to low inter- and intra-rater agreements. More and more Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to help pathologists perform and standardize their diagnosis. However, those models can render their prediction without consideration of the ambiguity of the classes and can fail without notice which prevent their wider acceptance in a clinical context. In this paper, we propose a new score to measure the confidence of AI models in grading tasks. Our confidence score is specifically adapted to ordinal output variables, is versatile and does not require extra training or additional inferences nor particular architecture changes. Comparison to other popular techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout and deep ensembles shows that our method provides state-of-the art results, while being simpler, more versatile and less computationally intensive. The score is also easily interpretable and consistent with real life hesitations of pathologists. We show that the score is capable of accurately identifying mispredicted slides and that accuracy for high confidence decisions is significantly higher than for low-confidence decisions (gap in AUC of 17.1% on the test set). We believe that the proposed confidence score could be leveraged by pathologists directly in their workflow and assist them on difficult tasks such as grading precancerous lesions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Self-Supervised Learning of Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04763v1)** | 2023-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Presenting whole slide images (WSIs) as graph will enable a more efficient and accurate learning framework for cancer diagnosis. Due to the fact that a single WSI consists of billions of pixels and there is a lack of vast annotated datasets required for computational pathology, the problem of learning from WSIs using typical deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural network (CNN) is challenging. Additionally, WSIs down-sampling may lead to the loss of data that is essential for cancer detection. A novel two-stage learning technique is presented in this work. Since context, such as topological features in the tumor surroundings, may hold important information for cancer grading and diagnosis, a graph representation capturing all dependencies among regions in the WSI is very intuitive. Graph convolutional network (GCN) is deployed to include context from the tumor and adjacent tissues, and self-supervised learning is used to enhance training through unlabeled data. More specifically, the entire slide is presented as a graph, where the nodes correspond to the patches from the WSI. The proposed framework is then tested using WSIs from prostate and kidney cancers. To assess the performance improvement through self-supervised mechanism, the proposed context-aware model is tested with and without use of pre-trained self-supervised layer. The overall model is also compared with multi-instance learning (MIL) based and other existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideGraph+: Whole Slide Image Level Graphs to Predict HER2Status in Breast Cancer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06042v1)** | 2021-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important prognostic and predictive factor which is overexpressed in 15-20% of breast cancer (BCa). The determination of its status is a key clinical decision making step for selection of treatment regimen and prognostication. HER2 status is evaluated using transcroptomics or immunohistochemistry (IHC) through situ hybridisation (ISH) which require additional costs and tissue burden in addition to analytical variabilities in terms of manual observational biases in scoring. In this study, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) based model (termed SlideGraph+) to predict HER2 status directly from whole-slide images of routine Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides. The network was trained and tested on slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in addition to two independent test datasets. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values > 0.75 on TCGA and 0.8 on independent test sets. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can be utilised for case triaging as well as pre-ordering diagnostic tests in a diagnostic setting. It can also be used for other weakly supervised prediction problems in computational pathology.

| **[Differentiable Zooming for Multiple Instance Learning on Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12454v4)** | 2022-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have become increasingly popular for classifying giga-pixel sized Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) in digital pathology. Most MIL methods operate at a single WSI magnification, by processing all the tissue patches. Such a formulation induces high computational requirements, and constrains the contextualization of the WSI-level representation to a single scale. A few MIL methods extend to multiple scales, but are computationally more demanding. In this paper, inspired by the pathological diagnostic process, we propose ZoomMIL, a method that learns to perform multi-level zooming in an end-to-end manner. ZoomMIL builds WSI representations by aggregating tissue-context information from multiple magnifications. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods in WSI classification on two large datasets, while significantly reducing the computational demands with regard to Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) and processing time by up to 40x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Typos...</summary><p>Typos corrected; Changed dataset name from INSEC to CRC upon dataset creators' request; Update affiliation and fix typos;</p></details> |

In most MIL based analytical pipelines for WSI-level analysis, the WSIs are often divided into patches and deep features for patches (i.e., patch embeddings) are extracted prior to training to reduce the overall computational cost and cope with the GPUs' limited RAM. To overcome this limitation, we present EmbAugmenter, a data augmentation generative adversarial network (DA-GAN) that can synthesize data augmentations in the embedding space rather than in the pixel space, thereby significantly reducing the computational requirements. Experiments on the SICAPv2 dataset show that our approach outperforms MIL without augmentation and is on par with traditional patch-level augmentation for MIL training while being substantially faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, ISBI 2023</p></details> |
| **[Unsupervised Mutual Transformer Learning for Multi-Gigapixel Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02032v1)** | 2023-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is an important prediction task in the emerging area of computational pathology. There has been a surge of research in deep learning models for WSI classification with clinical applications such as cancer detection or prediction of molecular mutations from WSIs. Most methods require expensive and labor-intensive manual annotations by expert pathologists. Weakly supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have recently demonstrated excellent performance; however, they still require large slide-level labeled training datasets that need a careful inspection of each slide by an expert pathologist. In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised WSI classification algorithm based on mutual transformer learning. Instances from gigapixel WSI (i.e., image patches) are transformed into a latent space and then inverse-transformed to the original space. Using the transformation loss, pseudo-labels are generated and cleaned using a transformer label-cleaner. The proposed transformer-based pseudo-label generation and cleaning modules mutually train each other iteratively in an unsupervised manner. A discriminative learning mechanism is introduced to improve normal versus cancerous instance labeling. In addition to unsupervised classification, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for weak supervision for cancer subtype classification as downstream analysis. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show excellent performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We intend to make the source code of our algorithm publicly available soon.</p></details> |  |

We proposed the ACDC@LungHP (Automatic Cancer Detection and Classification in Whole-slide Lung Histopathology) challenge for evaluating different computer-aided diagnosis (CADs) methods on the automatic diagnosis of lung cancer. The ACDC@LungHP 2019 focused on segmentation (pixel-wise detection) of cancer tissue in whole slide imaging (WSI), using an annotated dataset of 150 training images and 50 test images from 200 patients. This paper reviews this challenge and summarizes the top 10 submitted methods for lung cancer segmentation. All methods were evaluated using the false positive rate, false negative rate, and DICE coefficient (DC). The DC ranged from 0.7354$\pm$0.1149 to 0.8372$\pm$0.0858. The DC of the best method was close to the inter-observer agreement (0.8398$\pm$0.0890). All methods were based on deep learning and categorized into two groups: multi-model method and single model method. In general, multi-model methods were significantly better ($\textit{p}$<$0.01$) than single model methods, with mean DC of 0.7966 and 0.7544, respectively. Deep learning based methods could potentially help pathologists find suspicious regions for further analysis of lung cancer in WSI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based generation of Histopathological Whole Slide Images at a Gigapixel scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08199v1)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel diffusion-based approach to generate synthetic histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) at an unprecedented gigapixel scale. Synthetic WSIs have many potential applications: They can augment training datasets to enhance the performance of many computational pathology applications. They allow the creation of synthesized copies of datasets that can be shared without violating privacy regulations. Or they can facilitate learning representations of WSIs without requiring data annotations. Despite this variety of applications, no existing deep-learning-based method generates WSIs at their typically high resolutions. Mainly due to the high computational complexity. Therefore, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine sampling scheme to tackle image generation of high-resolution WSIs. In this scheme, we increase the resolution of an initial low-resolution image to a high-resolution WSI. Particularly, a diffusion model sequentially adds fine details to images and increases their resolution. In our experiments, we train our method with WSIs from the TCGA-BRCA dataset. Additionally to quantitative evaluations, we also performed a user study with pathologists. The study results suggest that our generated WSIs resemble the structure of real WSIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tumor segmentation on whole slide images: training or prompting?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13932v1)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tumor segmentation stands as a pivotal task in cancer diagnosis. Given the immense dimensions of whole slide images (WSI) in histology, deep learning approaches for WSI classification mainly operate at patch-wise or superpixel-wise level. However, these solutions often struggle to capture global WSI information and cannot directly generate the binary mask. Downsampling the WSI and performing semantic segmentation is another possible approach. While this method offers computational efficiency, it necessitates a large amount of annotated data since resolution reduction may lead to information loss. Visual prompting is a novel paradigm that allows the model to perform new tasks by making subtle modifications to the input space, rather than adapting the model itself. Such approach has demonstrated promising results on many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we show the efficacy of visual prompting in the context of tumor segmentation for three distinct organs. In comparison to classical methods trained for this specific task, our findings reveal that, with appropriate prompt examples, visual prompting can achieve comparable or better performance without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, ISBI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Transformer for Survival Prediction Using Multimodality Whole Slide Images and Genomics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.16632v1)** | 2022-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning good representation of giga-pixel level whole slide pathology images (WSI) for downstream tasks is critical. Previous studies employ multiple instance learning (MIL) to represent WSIs as bags of sampled patches because, for most occasions, only slide-level labels are available, and only a tiny region of the WSI is disease-positive area. However, WSI representation learning still remains an open problem due to: (1) patch sampling on a higher resolution may be incapable of depicting microenvironment information such as the relative position between the tumor cells and surrounding tissues, while patches at lower resolution lose the fine-grained detail; (2) extracting patches from giant WSI results in large bag size, which tremendously increases the computational cost. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical-based multimodal transformer framework that learns a hierarchical mapping between pathology images and corresponding genes. Precisely, we randomly extract instant-level patch features from WSIs with different magnification. Then a co-attention mapping between imaging and genomics is learned to uncover the pairwise interaction and reduce the space complexity of imaging features. Such early fusion makes it computationally feasible to use MIL Transformer for the survival prediction task. Our architecture requires fewer GPU resources compared with benchmark methods while maintaining better WSI representation ability. We evaluate our approach on five cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas database and achieved an average c-index of $0.673$, outperforming the state-of-the-art multimodality methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICPR 2022</p></details> |

In computational pathology, where Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of digitally scanned tissue samples from patients can be multi-gigapixels in size, determination of degree of similarity between two WSIs is a challenging task with a number of practical applications. In this work, we explore a novel strategy based on kernelized Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) analysis for determination of pairwise similarity between WSIs. The proposed approach works by calculating MMD between two WSIs using kernels over deep features of image patches. This allows representation of an entire dataset of WSIs as a kernel matrix for WSI level clustering, weakly-supervised prediction of TP-53 mutation status in breast cancer patients from their routine WSIs as well as survival analysis with state of the art prediction performance. We believe that this work will open up further avenues for application of WSI-level kernels for predictive and prognostic tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>* Joi...</summary><p>* Joint first authorship Accepted: IEEE - ISBI 2023 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging</p></details> |

Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions.

In this paper, we propose a kernel attention Transformer (KAT) for histopathology WSI classification. The information transmission of the tokens is achieved by cross-attention between the tokens and a set of kernels related to a set of positional anchors on the WSI. Compared to the common Transformer structure, the proposed KAT can better describe the hierarchical context information of the local regions of the WSI and meanwhile maintains a lower computational complexity. The proposed method was evaluated on a gastric dataset with 2040 WSIs and an endometrial dataset with 2560 WSIs, and was compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed KAT is effective and efficient in the task of histopathology WSI classification and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

To address these issues, we propose MExD, an Expert-Infused Diffusion Model that combines the strengths of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with a diffusion model for enhanced classification. MExD balances patch feature distribution through a novel MoE-based aggregator that selectively emphasizes relevant information, effectively filtering noise, addressing data imbalance, and extracting essential features. These features are then integrated via a diffusion-based generative process to directly yield the class distribution for the WSI. Moving beyond conventional discriminative approaches, MExD represents the first generative strategy in WSI classification, capturing fine-grained details for robust and precise results. Our MExD is validated on three widely-used benchmarks-Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and BRACS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in both binary and multi-class tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |

We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p></details> |  |

Each patch of a mosaic is encoded to a feature vector using a deep network. The feature extractor model is fine-tuned using hierarchical target labels of WSIs, i.e., anatomic site and primary diagnosis. In the second stage, a set of encoded patch-level features from a WSI is used to compute the primary diagnosis probability through the proposed Pay Attention with Focus scheme, an attention-weighted averaging of predicted probabilities for all patches of a mosaic modulated by a trainable focal factor. Experimental results show that the proposed model can be robust, and effective for the classification of WSIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in MICCAI, 2021</p></details> |
| **[Yottixel -- An Image Search Engine for Large Archives of Histopathology Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08748v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of digital pathology, searching for similar images in large archives has gained considerable attention. Image retrieval can provide pathologists with unprecedented access to the evidence embodied in already diagnosed and treated cases from the past. This paper proposes a search engine specialized for digital pathology, called Yottixel, a portmanteau for "one yotta pixel," alluding to the big-data nature of histopathology images. The most impressive characteristic of Yottixel is its ability to represent whole slide images (WSIs) in a compact manner. Yottixel can perform millions of searches in real-time with a high search accuracy and low storage profile. Yottixel uses an intelligent indexing algorithm capable of representing WSIs with a mosaic of patches by converting them into a small number of methodically extracted barcodes, called "Bunch of Barcodes" (BoB), the most prominent performance enabler of Yottixel. The performance of the prototype platform is qualitatively tested using 300 WSIs from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and 2,020 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) provided by the National Cancer Institute. Both datasets amount to more than 4,000,000 patches of 1000x1000 pixels. We report three sets of experiments that show that Yottixel can accurately retrieve organs and malignancies, and its semantic ordering shows good agreement with the subjective evaluation of human observers.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically rely on pre-trained models from large natural image datasets, such as ImageNet, to generate instance features, which can be sub-optimal due to the significant differences between natural images and histopathology images that lead to a domain shift. In this paper, we present a novel, simple yet effective method for learning domain-specific knowledge transformation from pre-trained models to histopathology images. Our approach entails using a prompt component to assist the pre-trained model in discerning differences between the pre-trained dataset and the target histopathology dataset, resulting in improved performance of MIL models. We validate our method on two publicly available datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our method for different MIL models and backbones. Upon publication of this paper, we will release the source code for our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI 2023</p></details> |

In this study, we investigated whether deep learning algorithms can predict patients' risk of recurrence by analyzing the pathology images of their cancer histology.We analyzed 125 hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from 125 patients across two institutions (National Cancer Center and Korea University Medical Center Guro Hospital) to predict breast cancer recurrence risk using deep learning. Sensitivity reached 0.857, 0.746, and 0.529 for low, intermediate, and high-risk categories, respectively, with specificity of 0.816, 0.803, and 0.972, and a Pearson correlation of 0.61 with histological grade. Class activation maps highlighted features like tubule formation and mitotic rate, suggesting a cost-effective approach to risk stratification, pending broader validation. These findings suggest that deep learning models trained exclusively on hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images can approximate genomic assay results, offering a cost-effective and scalable tool for breast cancer recurrence risk assessment.

Existing methods fail to simultaneously extract global structural and local detail features for comprehensive pathology image analysis efficiently. To address these limitations, we propose a self-calibration enhanced framework for whole slide pathology image analysis, comprising three components: a global branch, a focus predictor, and a detailed branch. The global branch initially classifies using the pathological thumbnail, while the focus predictor identifies relevant regions for classification based on the last layer features of the global branch. The detailed extraction branch then assesses whether the magnified regions correspond to the lesion area. Finally, a feature consistency constraint between the global and detail branches ensures that the global branch focuses on the appropriate region and extracts sufficient discriminative features for final identification. These focused discriminative features prove invaluable for uncovering novel prognostic tumor markers from the perspective of feature cluster uniqueness and tissue spatial distribution. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed framework can rapidly deliver accurate and explainable results for pathological grading and prognosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Whole Slide Images based Cancer Survival Prediction using Attention Guided Deep Multiple Instance Learning Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11169v1)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional image-based survival prediction models rely on discriminative patch labeling which make those methods not scalable to extend to large datasets. Recent studies have shown Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework is useful for histopathological images when no annotations are available in classification task. Different to the current image-based survival models that limit to key patches or clusters derived from Whole Slide Images (WSIs), we propose Deep Attention Multiple Instance Survival Learning (DeepAttnMISL) by introducing both siamese MI-FCN and attention-based MIL pooling to efficiently learn imaging features from the WSI and then aggregate WSI-level information to patient-level. Attention-based aggregation is more flexible and adaptive than aggregation techniques in recent survival models. We evaluated our methods on two large cancer whole slide images datasets and our results suggest that the proposed approach is more effective and suitable for large datasets and has better interpretability in locating important patterns and features that contribute to accurate cancer survival predictions. The proposed framework can also be used to assess individual patient's risk and thus assisting in delivering personalized medicine.

There are $5$ major histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, each with distinct morphological, genetic, and clinical features. Currently, these histotypes are determined by a pathologist's microscopic examination of tumor whole-slide images (WSI). This process has been hampered by poor inter-observer agreement (Cohen's kappa $0.54$-$0.67$). We utilized a \textit{two}-stage deep transfer learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and progressive resizing for automatic classification of epithelial ovarian carcinoma WSIs. The proposed algorithm achieved a mean accuracy of $87.54\%$ and Cohen's kappa of $0.8106$ in the slide-level classification of $305$ WSIs; performing better than a standard CNN and pathologists without gynecology-specific training.</p></details> |  |

Tools to assist in making a diagnosis are required to manage the increasing workload. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep-learning based tools may be used in daily pathology practice. However, it is challenging to develop fast and reliable algorithms that can be trusted by practitioners, whatever the medical center. We describe a patch-based algorithm that incorporates a convolutional neural network to detect and locate invasive carcinoma on breast whole-slide images. The network was trained on a dataset extracted from a reference acquisition center. We then performed a calibration step based on transfer learning to maintain the performance when translating on a new target acquisition center by using a limited amount of additional training data. Performance was evaluated using classical binary measures (accuracy, recall, precision) for both centers (referred to as test reference dataset and test target dataset) and at two levels: patch and slide level. At patch level, accuracy, recall, and precision of the model on the reference and target test sets were 92.1\% and 96.3\%, 95\% and 87.8\%, and 73.9\% and 70.6\%, respectively. At slide level, accuracy, recall, and precision were 97.6\% and 92.0\%, 90.9\% and 100\%, and 100\% and 70.8\% for test sets 1 and 2, respectively. The high performance of the algorithm at both centers shows that the calibration process is efficient. This is performed using limited training data from the new target acquisition center and requires that the model is trained beforehand on a large database from a reference center. This methodology allows the implementation of AI diagnostic tools to help in routine pathology practice.</p></details> |  |

WSIs pose great challenges to deep learning models for clinical diagnosis, owing to their size and lack of pixel-level annotations. With the recent advancements in computational pathology, newer multiple-instance learning-based models have been proposed. Multiple-instance learning for WSIs necessitates creating patches and uses the encoding of these patches for diagnosis. These models use generic pre-trained models (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) for patch encoding. The recently proposed KimiaNet, a DenseNet121 model pre-trained on TCGA slides, is a domain-specific pre-trained model. This paper shows the effect of domain-specific pre-training on WSI classification. To investigate the effect of domain-specific pre-training, we considered the current state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models, 1) CLAM, an attention-based model, and 2) TransMIL, a self-attention-based model, and evaluated the models' confidence and predictive performance in detecting primary brain tumors - gliomas. Domain-specific pre-training improves the confidence of the models and also achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of WSI-based glioma subtype classification, showing a high clinical applicability in assisting glioma diagnosis. We will publicly share our code and experimental results at https://github.com/soham-chitnis10/WSI-domain-specific.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMBC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MHAttnSurv: Multi-Head Attention for Survival Prediction Using Whole-Slide Pathology Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11558v1)** | 2021-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pathology, whole-slide images (WSI) based survival prediction has attracted increasing interest. However, given the large size of WSIs and the lack of pathologist annotations, extracting the prognostic information from WSIs remains a challenging task. Previous studies have used multiple instance learning approaches to combine the information from multiple randomly sampled patches, but different visual patterns may contribute differently to prognosis prediction. In this study, we developed a multi-head attention approach to focus on various parts of a tumor slide, for more comprehensive information extraction from WSIs. We evaluated our approach on four cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Our model achieved an average c-index of 0.640, outperforming two existing state-of-the-art approaches for WSI-based survival prediction, which have an average c-index of 0.603 and 0.619 on these datasets. Visualization of our attention maps reveals each attention head focuses synergistically on different morphological patterns.</p></details> |  |

First, the lack of hand-annotated datasets to train algorithms. Second, the lack of interactive paradigms to enable a dialogue between the pathologist and the machine, which can be a major obstacle for use in clinical routine. We therefore propose a fast and user oriented method to bridge this gap by giving the pathologist control over the final result while limiting the number of interactions needed to achieve a good result (over 90\% on all our metrics with only 4 correction scribbles).</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact and De-biased Negative Instance Embedding for Multi-Instance Learning on Whole-Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10595v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) classification is a challenging task because 1) patches from WSI lack annotation, and 2) WSI possesses unnecessary variability, e.g., stain protocol. Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/pathology_mil.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024</p></details> |
| **[A graph-transformer for whole slide image classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09671v1)** | 2022-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is a powerful tool for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. Typically, when performing supervised deep learning, a WSI is divided into small patches, trained and the outcomes are aggregated to estimate disease grade. However, patch-based methods introduce label noise during training by assuming that each patch is independent with the same label as the WSI and neglect overall WSI-level information that is significant in disease grading. Here we present a Graph-Transformer (GT) that fuses a graph-based representation of an WSI and a vision transformer for processing pathology images, called GTP, to predict disease grade. We selected $4,818$ WSIs from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and used GTP to distinguish adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) from adjacent non-cancerous tissue (normal). First, using NLST data, we developed a contrastive learning framework to generate a feature extractor. This allowed us to compute feature vectors of individual WSI patches, which were used to represent the nodes of the graph followed by construction of the GTP framework. Our model trained on the CPTAC data achieved consistently high performance on three-label classification (normal versus LUAD versus LSCC: mean accuracy$= 91.2$ $\pm$ $2.5\%$) based on five-fold cross-validation, and mean accuracy $= 82.3$ $\pm$ $1.0\%$ on external test data (TCGA). We also introduced a graph-based saliency mapping technique, called GraphCAM, that can identify regions that are highly associated with the class label. Our findings demonstrate GTP as an interpretable and effective deep learning framework for WSI-level classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[A deep learning based multiscale approach to segment cancer area in liver whole slide image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12935v1)** | 2020-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of liver cancer segmentation in Whole Slide Image (WSI). We propose a multi-scale image processing method based on automatic end-to-end deep neural network algorithm for segmentation of cancer area. A seven-levels gaussian pyramid representation of the histopathological image was built to provide the texture information in different scales. In this work, several neural architectures were compared using the original image level for the training procedure. The proposed method is based on U-Net applied to seven levels of various resolutions (pyramidal subsumpling). The predictions in different levels are combined through a voting mechanism. The final segmentation result is generated at the original image level. Partial color normalization and weighted overlapping method were applied in preprocessing and prediction separately. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed multi-scales approach achieving better scores compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Image Classification through Fisher Vector Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08530v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of digital pathology, particularly through computational analysis of whole slide images (WSI), is poised to significantly enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency. However, the large size and complexity of WSIs make it difficult to analyze and classify them using computers. This study introduces a novel method for WSI classification by automating the identification and examination of the most informative patches, thus eliminating the need to process the entire slide. Our method involves two-stages: firstly, it extracts only a few patches from the WSIs based on their pathological significance; and secondly, it employs Fisher vectors (FVs) for representing features extracted from these patches, which is known for its robustness in capturing fine-grained details. This approach not only accentuates key pathological features within the WSI representation but also significantly reduces computational overhead, thus making the process more efficient and scalable. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed method across multiple datasets to benchmark its performance against comprehensive WSI analysis and contemporary weakly-supervised learning methodologies. The empirical results indicate that our focused analysis of select patches, combined with Fisher vector representation, not only aligns with, but at times surpasses, the classification accuracy of standard practices. Moreover, this strategy notably diminishes computational load and resource expenditure, thereby establishing an efficient and precise framework for WSI analysis in the realm of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Classification of positive and negative Ki67 cells in histology slides is a common approach to determine cancer proliferation status. However, there is a lack of generalizable and accurate methods to automate Ki67 scoring in large-scale patient cohorts. In this work, we have employed a novel deep learning technique based on hypercolumn descriptors for cell classification in Ki67 images. Specifically, we developed the Simultaneous Detection and Cell Segmentation (DeepSDCS) network to perform cell segmentation and detection. VGG16 network was used for the training and fine tuning to training data. We extracted the hypercolumn descriptors of each cell to form the vector of activation from specific layers to capture features at different granularity. Features from these layers that correspond to the same pixel were propagated using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer to yield the detection of the nuclei and the final cell segmentations. Subsequently, seeds generated from cell segmentation were propagated to a spatially constrained convolutional neural network for the classification of the cells into stromal, lymphocyte, Ki67-positive cancer cell, and Ki67-negative cancer cell. We validated its accuracy in the context of a large-scale clinical trial of oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. We achieved 99.06% and 89.59% accuracy on two separate test sets of Ki67 stained breast cancer dataset comprising biopsy and whole-slide images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Prototypical Transformer for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02308v1)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) classification is an essential task in computational pathology. Despite the recent advances in multiple instance learning (MIL) for WSI classification, accurate classification of WSIs remains challenging due to the extreme imbalance between the positive and negative instances in bags, and the complicated pre-processing to fuse multi-scale information of WSI. To this end, we propose a novel multi-scale prototypical Transformer (MSPT) for WSI classification, which includes a prototypical Transformer (PT) module and a multi-scale feature fusion module (MFFM). The PT is developed to reduce redundant instances in bags by integrating prototypical learning into the Transformer architecture. It substitutes all instances with cluster prototypes, which are then re-calibrated through the self-attention mechanism of the Trans-former. Thereafter, an MFFM is proposed to fuse the clustered prototypes of different scales, which employs MLP-Mixer to enhance the information communication between prototypes. The experimental results on two public WSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSPT outperforms all the compared algorithms, suggesting its potential applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantics-Aware Attention Guidance for Diagnosing Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10894v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in digital pathology, largely due to the gigapixel size and complex spatial relationships present in whole slide images. Traditional multiple instance learning (MIL) methods often struggle with these intricacies, especially in preserving the necessary context for accurate diagnosis. In response, we introduce a novel framework named Semantics-Aware Attention Guidance (SAG), which includes 1) a technique for converting diagnostically relevant entities into attention signals, and 2) a flexible attention loss that efficiently integrates various semantically significant information, such as tissue anatomy and cancerous regions. Our experiments on two distinct cancer datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy, precision, and recall with two state-of-the-art baseline models. Qualitative analysis further reveals that the incorporation of heuristic guidance enables the model to focus on regions critical for diagnosis. SAG is not only effective for the models discussed here, but its adaptability extends to any attention-based diagnostic model. This opens up exciting possibilities for further improving the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the size and high-resolution nature of these images, they are generally only accessed in smaller sections or tiles via specialized platforms, most of which require extensive setup and/or costly infrastructure. These platforms typically also need a copy of the images to be locally available to them, potentially causing issues with data governance and provenance. To address these concerns, we developed ImageBox3, an in-browser tiling mechanism to enable zero-footprint traversal of remote WSI data. All computation is performed client-side without compromising user governance, operating public and private images alike as long as the storage service supports HTTP range requests (standard in Cloud storage and most web servers). ImageBox3 thus removes significant hurdles to WSI operation and effective collaboration, allowing for the sort of democratized analytical tools needed to establish participative, FAIR digital pathology data commons.

However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic challenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\sim$100K pixels), making them infeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often only slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are tedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using multiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these challenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework into two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the patches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level prediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the representations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end framework that clusters the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples ${k}'$ patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention mechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have demonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training by exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches. We regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss between the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform distribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level cross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss (Implementation: https://github.com/YashSharma/C2C).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MIDL, 2021 - https://openreview.net/forum?id=7i1-2oKIELU</p></details> |

The appearance disparity of pathological whole slide images causes algorithms to become less reliable, which in turn impedes the wide-spread applicability of downstream tasks like cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, different stainings lead to biases in the training which in case of domain shifts negatively affect the test performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose MultiStain-CycleGAN, a multi-domain approach to stain normalization based on CycleGAN. Our modifications to CycleGAN allow us to normalize images of different origins without retraining or using different models. We perform an extensive evaluation of our method using various metrics and compare it to commonly used methods that are multi-domain capable. First, we evaluate how well our method fools a domain classifier that tries to assign a medical center to an image. Then, we test our normalization on the tumor classification performance of a downstream classifier. Furthermore, we evaluate the image quality of the normalized images using the Structural similarity index and the ability to reduce the domain shift using the Fréchet inception distance. We show that our method proves to be multi-domain capable, provides the highest image quality among the compared methods, and can most reliably fool the domain classifier while keeping the tumor classifier performance high. By reducing the domain influence, biases in the data can be removed on the one hand and the origin of the whole slide image can be disguised on the other, thus enhancing patient data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, we utilize `partial' label proportions, which give the proportions among tumor subtypes but do not give the proportion between tumor and non-tumor. Partial label proportions are recorded as the standard diagnostic information by pathologists, and we, therefore, want to use them for realizing the segmentation model that can classify each WSI patch into one of the tumor subtypes or non-tumor. We call this problem ``learning from partial label proportions (LPLP)'' and formulate the problem as a weakly supervised learning problem. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for this challenging problem by decomposing it into two weakly supervised learning subproblems: multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP). These subproblems are optimized efficiently in the end-to-end manner. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through experiments conducted on two WSI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI2024</p></details> |

To develop computer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level labels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise interactions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority.

However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Current methods typically rely on manual region labeling or multi-stage learning to assemble local representations (e.g., patch-level) into global features (e.g., slide-level). However, there is no effective way to integrate multi-scale image representations with text data in a seamless end-to-end process. In this study, we introduce Multi-Level Text-Guided Representation End-to-End Learning (mTREE). This novel text-guided approach effectively captures multi-scale WSI representations by utilizing information from accompanying textual pathology information. mTREE innovatively combines - the localization of key areas (global-to-local) and the development of a WSI-level image-text representation (local-to-global) - into a unified, end-to-end learning framework. In this model, textual information serves a dual purpose: firstly, functioning as an attention map to accurately identify key areas, and secondly, acting as a conduit for integrating textual features into the comprehensive representation of the image. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of mTREE through quantitative analyses in two image-related tasks: classification and survival prediction, showcasing its remarkable superiority over baselines.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MIL methods do not explicitly model the data distribution, and instead they only learn a bag-level or instance-level decision boundary discriminatively by training a classifier. In this paper, we propose DGMIL: a feature distribution guided deep MIL framework for WSI classification and positive patch localization. Instead of designing complex discriminative network architectures, we reveal that the inherent feature distribution of histopathological image data can serve as a very effective guide for instance classification. We propose a cluster-conditioned feature distribution modeling method and a pseudo label-based iterative feature space refinement strategy so that in the final feature space the positive and negative instances can be easily separated. Experiments on the CAMELYON16 dataset and the TCGA Lung Cancer dataset show that our method achieves new SOTA for both global classification and positive patch localization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by MICCAI 2022</p></details> |

The annotation of an asthma microscopy whole slide image (WSI) is an extremely labour-intensive task due to the hundreds of thousands of cells per WSI. To overcome the limitation of annotating WSI incompletely, we developed a training pipeline which can train a deep learning-based object detection model with partially annotated WSIs and compensate class imbalances on the fly. With this approach we can freely sample from annotated WSIs areas and are not restricted to fully annotated extracted sub-images of the WSI as with classical approaches. We evaluated our pipeline in a cross-validation setup with a fixed training set using a dataset of six equine WSIs of which four are partially annotated and used for training, and two fully annotated WSI are used for validation and testing. Our WSI-based training approach outperformed classical sub-image-based training methods by up to 15\% $mAP$ and yielded human-like performance when compared to the annotations of ten trained pathologists.</p></details> | Submitted to BVM |
| **[FAST: A Dual-tier Few-Shot Learning Paradigm for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19720v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the primary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole Slide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike few-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of each image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small number of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in order to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining of available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level annotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs at the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to fully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch labels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the labels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch classification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior branch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of visual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the results from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches the accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\%$ annotation costs. All codes and models will be publicly available on https://github.com/fukexue/FAST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Integrative Graph-Transformer Framework for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Representation and Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18134v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In digital pathology, the multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy is widely used in the weakly supervised histopathology whole slide image (WSI) classification task where giga-pixel WSIs are only labeled at the slide level. However, existing attention-based MIL approaches often overlook contextual information and intrinsic spatial relationships between neighboring tissue tiles, while graph-based MIL frameworks have limited power to recognize the long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce the integrative graph-transformer framework that simultaneously captures the context-aware relational features and global WSI representations through a novel Graph Transformer Integration (GTI) block. Specifically, each GTI block consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer modeling neighboring relations at the local instance level and an efficient global attention model capturing comprehensive global information from extensive feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and BRIGHT, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art MIL methods, achieving an improvement of 1.0% to 2.6% in accuracy and 0.7%-1.6% in AUROC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patch-based Convolutional Neural Network for Whole Slide Tissue Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07947v5)** | 2016-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are state-of-the-art models for many image classification tasks. However, to recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method is similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists. Although it is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we experimentally demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset of smaller images that a patch-based CNN can outperform an image-based CNN.</p></details> |  |

This hierarchical structure is believed to be beneficial for cancer diagnosis and prognosis tasks. However, most previous hierarchical WSI analysis works (1) only characterize local or global correlations within the WSI pyramids and (2) use only unidirectional interaction between different resolutions, leading to an incomplete picture of WSI pyramids. To this end, this paper presents a novel Hierarchical Interaction Graph-Transformer (i.e., HIGT) for WSI analysis. With Graph Neural Network and Transformer as the building commons, HIGT can learn both short-range local information and long-range global representation of the WSI pyramids. Considering that the information from different resolutions is complementary and can benefit each other during the learning process, we further design a novel Bidirectional Interaction block to establish communication between different levels within the WSI pyramids. Finally, we aggregate both coarse-grained and fine-grained features learned from different levels together for slide-level prediction. We evaluate our methods on two public WSI datasets from TCGA projects, i.e., kidney carcinoma (KICA) and esophageal carcinoma (ESCA). Experimental results show that our HIGT outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical state-of-the-art methods on both tumor subtyping and staging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2023; Code is available in https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/HIGT</p></details> |

Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, we propose a whole slide image (WSI) based genetic biomarker prediction method via prompting techniques. Our work aims at addressing the following challenges: (1) extracting foreground instances related to genetic biomarkers from gigapixel WSIs, and (2) the interaction among the fine-grained pathological components in WSIs.Specifically, we leverage large language models to generate medical prompts that serve as prior knowledge in extracting instances associated with genetic biomarkers. We adopt a coarse-to-fine approach to mine biomarker information within the tumor microenvironment. This involves extracting instances related to genetic biomarkers using coarse medical prior knowledge, grouping pathology instances into fine-grained pathological components and mining their interactions. Experimental results on two colorectal cancer datasets show the superiority of our method, achieving 91.49% in AUC for MSI classification. The analysis further shows the clinical interpretability of our method.

Subtype-guided Masked Transformer for Pathological Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20607v1)** | 2023-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological captioning of Whole Slide Images (WSIs), though is essential in computer-aided pathological diagnosis, has rarely been studied due to the limitations in datasets and model training efficacy. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm Subtype-guided Masked Transformer (SGMT) for pathological captioning based on Transformers, which treats a WSI as a sequence of sparse patches and generates an overall caption sentence from the sequence. An accompanying subtype prediction is introduced into SGMT to guide the training process and enhance the captioning accuracy. We also present an Asymmetric Masked Mechansim approach to tackle the large size constraint of pathological image captioning, where the numbers of sequencing patches in SGMT are sampled differently in the training and inferring phases, respectively. Experiments on the PatchGastricADC22 dataset demonstrate that our approach effectively adapts to the task with a transformer-based model and achieves superior performance than traditional RNN-based methods. Our codes are to be made available for further research and development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Semi-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification by Two-level Cross Consistency Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12132v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical pathological diagnosis. It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.</p></details> |  |

In computational pathology, domain-specific VLMs, which are pre-trained on extensive histopathology image-text datasets, have succeeded in various downstream tasks. However, existing research has primarily focused on the pre-training process and direct applications of VLMs on the patch level, leaving their great potential for whole slide image (WSI) applications unexplored. In this study, we hypothesize that pre-trained VLMs inherently capture informative and interpretable WSI representations through quantitative feature extraction. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce Vision and Language Embeddings for Explainable WSI Representation (VLEER), a novel method designed to leverage VLMs for WSI representation. We systematically evaluate VLEER on three pathological WSI datasets, proving its better performance in WSI analysis compared to conventional vision features. More importantly, VLEER offers the unique advantage of interpretability, enabling direct human-readable insights into the results by leveraging the textual modality for detailed pathology annotations, providing clear reasoning for WSI-level pathology downstream tasks.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing approaches typically rely on frozen pre-trained models to extract instance features, neglecting the substantial domain shift between pre-training natural and histopathological images. To address this issue, we propose PAMT, a novel Prompt-guided Adaptive Model Transformation framework that enhances MIL classification performance by seamlessly adapting pre-trained models to the specific characteristics of histopathology data. To capture the intricate histopathology distribution, we introduce Representative Patch Sampling (RPS) and Prototypical Visual Prompt (PVP) to reform the input data, building a compact while informative representation. Furthermore, to narrow the domain gap, we introduce Adaptive Model Transformation (AMT) that integrates adapter blocks within the feature extraction pipeline, enabling the pre-trained models to learn domain-specific features. We rigorously evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC, showcasing substantial improvements across various MIL models. Our findings affirm the potential of PAMT to set a new benchmark in WSI classification, underscoring the value of a targeted reprogramming approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[LESS: Label-efficient Multi-scale Learning for Cytological Whole Slide Image Screening](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03407v2)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, multiple instance learning (MIL) is widely used to circumvent the computational impasse in giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI) analysis. It usually consists of two stages: patch-level feature extraction and slide-level aggregation. Recently, pretrained models or self-supervised learning have been used to extract patch features, but they suffer from low effectiveness or inefficiency due to overlooking the task-specific supervision provided by slide labels. Here we propose a weakly-supervised Label-Efficient WSI Screening method, dubbed LESS, for cytological WSI analysis with only slide-level labels, which can be effectively applied to small datasets. First, we suggest using variational positive-unlabeled (VPU) learning to uncover hidden labels of both benign and malignant patches. We provide appropriate supervision by using slide-level labels to improve the learning of patch-level features. Next, we take into account the sparse and random arrangement of cells in cytological WSIs. To address this, we propose a strategy to crop patches at multiple scales and utilize a cross-attention vision transformer (CrossViT) to combine information from different scales for WSI classification. The combination of our two steps achieves task-alignment, improving effectiveness and efficiency. We validate the proposed label-efficient method on a urine cytology WSI dataset encompassing 130 samples (13,000 patches) and FNAC 2019 dataset with 212 samples (21,200 patches). The experiment shows that the proposed LESS reaches 84.79%, 85.43%, 91.79% and 78.30% on a urine cytology WSI dataset, and 96.88%, 96.86%, 98.95%, 97.06% on FNAC 2019 dataset in terms of accuracy, AUC, sensitivity and specificity. It outperforms state-of-the-art MIL methods on pathology WSIs and realizes automatic cytological WSI cancer screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to Medical Image Analysis.

Although the existing multi-scale vision Transformer has shown its effectiveness for learning multi-scale image representation, it still cannot work well on the gigapixel WSIs due to their extremely large image sizes. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-scale Efficient Graph-Transformer (MEGT) framework for WSI classification. The key idea of MEGT is to adopt two independent Efficient Graph-based Transformer (EGT) branches to process the low-resolution and high-resolution patch embeddings (i.e., tokens in a Transformer) of WSIs, respectively, and then fuse these tokens via a multi-scale feature fusion module (MFFM). Specifically, we design an EGT to efficiently learn the local-global information of patch tokens, which integrates the graph representation into Transformer to capture spatial-related information of WSIs. Meanwhile, we propose a novel MFFM to alleviate the semantic gap among different resolution patches during feature fusion, which creates a non-patch token for each branch as an agent to exchange information with another branch by cross-attention. In addition, to expedite network training, a novel token pruning module is developed in EGT to reduce the redundant tokens. Extensive experiments on TCGA-RCC and CAMELYON16 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MEGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20653v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[RetMIL: Retentive Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10858v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis with deep learning has become a research focus in computational pathology. The current paradigm is mainly based on multiple instance learning (MIL), in which approaches with Transformer as the backbone are well discussed. These methods convert WSI tasks into sequence tasks by representing patches as tokens in the WSI sequence. However, the feature complexity brought by high heterogeneity and the ultra-long sequences brought by gigapixel size makes Transformer-based MIL suffer from the challenges of high memory consumption, slow inference speed, and lack of performance. To this end, we propose a retentive MIL method called RetMIL, which processes WSI sequences through hierarchical feature propagation structure. At the local level, the WSI sequence is divided into multiple subsequences. Tokens of each subsequence are updated through a parallel linear retention mechanism and aggregated utilizing an attention layer. At the global level, subsequences are fused into a global sequence, then updated through a serial retention mechanism, and finally the slide-level representation is obtained through a global attention pooling. We conduct experiments on two public CAMELYON and BRACS datasets and an public-internal LUNG dataset, confirming that RetMIL not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly reduces computational overhead. Our code will be accessed shortly.</p></details> | under review |

However, generating automatic tools for processing WSIs is challenging due to their enormous sizes. Currently, to deal with this issue, conventional methods rely on a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy to process a WSI at patch level. Although effective, such methods are computationally expensive, because tiling a WSI into patches takes time and does not explore the spatial relations between these tiles. To tackle these limitations, we propose a locally supervised learning framework which processes the entire slide by exploring the entire local and global information that it contains. This framework divides a pre-trained network into several modules and optimizes each module locally using an auxiliary model. We also introduce a random feature reconstruction unit (RFR) to preserve distinguishing features during training and improve the performance of our method by 1% to 3%. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and LKS, highlight the superiority of our method on different classification tasks. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods by 2% to 5% in accuracy, while being 7 to 10 times faster. Additionally, when dividing it into eight modules, our method requires as little as 20% of the total gpu memory required by end-to-end training.

Manual quantification of immune cells is inaccurate and time consuming for pathologists. Our aim is to leverage a computational solution to automatically quantify TILs in whole slide images (WSIs) of standard diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin stained sections (H&E slides) from lung cancer patients. Our approach is to transfer an open source machine learning method for segmentation and classification of nuclei in H&E slides trained on public data to TIL quantification without manual labeling of our data. Our results show that additional augmentation improves model transferability when training on few samples/limited tissue types. Models trained with sufficient samples/tissue types do not benefit from our additional augmentation policy. Further, the resulting TIL quantification correlates to patient prognosis and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art method for immune cell detection in non-small lung cancer (current standard CD8 cells in DAB stained TMAs HR 0.34 95% CI 0.17-0.68 vs TILs in HE WSIs: HoVer-Net PanNuke Aug Model HR 0.30 95% CI 0.15-0.60, HoVer-Net MoNuSAC Aug model HR 0.27 95% CI 0.14-0.53). Moreover, we implemented a cloud based system to train, deploy and visually inspect machine learning based annotation for H&E slides. Our pragmatic approach bridges the gap between machine learning research, translational clinical research and clinical implementation. However, validation in prospective studies is needed to assert that the method works in a clinical setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 11 supplementary pages</p></details> |
| **[SOS: Selective Objective Switch for Rapid Immunofluorescence Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05080v1)** | 2020-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in clinical microscopy has been a long-standing barrier to implementing computer aided diagnostic systems. Since modern computing resources are unable to perform computations at this extremely large scale, current state of the art methods utilize patch-based processing to preserve the resolution of WSIs. However, these methods are often resource intensive and make significant compromises on processing time. In this paper, we demonstrate that conventional patch-based processing is redundant for certain WSI classification tasks where high resolution is only required in a minority of cases. This reflects what is observed in clinical practice; where a pathologist may screen slides using a low power objective and only switch to a high power in cases where they are uncertain about their findings. To eliminate these redundancies, we propose a method for the selective use of high resolution processing based on the confidence of predictions on downscaled WSIs --- we call this the Selective Objective Switch (SOS). Our method is validated on a novel dataset of 684 Liver-Kidney-Stomach immunofluorescence WSIs routinely used in the investigation of autoimmune liver disease. By limiting high resolution processing to cases which cannot be classified confidently at low resolution, we maintain the accuracy of patch-level analysis whilst reducing the inference time by a factor of 7.74.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at CVPR2020</p></details> |
| **[From Traditional to Deep Learning Approaches in Whole Slide Image Registration: A Methodological Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19123v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) registration is an essential task for analysing the tumour microenvironment (TME) in histopathology. It involves the alignment of spatial information between WSIs of the same section or serial sections of a tissue sample. The tissue sections are usually stained with single or multiple biomarkers before imaging, and the goal is to identify neighbouring nuclei along the Z-axis for creating a 3D image or identifying subclasses of cells in the TME. This task is considerably more challenging compared to radiology image registration, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, due to various factors. These include gigapixel size of images, variations in appearance between differently stained tissues, changes in structure and morphology between non-consecutive sections, and the presence of artefacts, tears, and deformations. Currently, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding a review of the current approaches and their limitations, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the available approaches and their application for various purposes. Furthermore, we investigate current deep learning methods used for WSI registration, emphasising their diverse methodologies. We examine the available datasets and explore tools and software employed in the field. Finally, we identify open challenges and potential future trends in this area of research.</p></details> |  |

For each focus point on the map, sample needs to be static in the x-y plane and axial scanning is needed to maximize the contrast. Here we report a novel focus map surveying method for WSI. The reported method requires no axial scanning, no additional camera and lens, works for stained and transparent samples, and allows continuous sample motion in the surveying process. It can be used for both brightfield and fluorescence WSI. By using a 20X, 0.75 NA objective lens, we demonstrate a mean focusing error of ~0.08 microns in the static mode and ~0.17 microns in the continuous motion mode. The reported method may provide a turnkey solution for most existing WSI systems for its simplicity, robustness, accuracy, and high-speed. It may also standardize the imaging performance of WSI systems for digital pathology and find other applications in high-content microscopy such as DNA sequencing and time-lapse live-cell imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning-based Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03081v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11846v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Extreme Learning Machines for Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning in Whole-Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10510v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image classification represents a key challenge in computational pathology and medicine. Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTFD-MIL: Double-Tier Feature Distillation Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12081v1)** | 2022-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been increasingly used in the classification of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). However, MIL approaches for this specific classification problem still face unique challenges, particularly those related to small sample cohorts. In these, there are limited number of WSI slides (bags), while the resolution of a single WSI is huge, which leads to a large number of patches (instances) cropped from this slide. To address this issue, we propose to virtually enlarge the number of bags by introducing the concept of pseudo-bags, on which a double-tier MIL framework is built to effectively use the intrinsic features. Besides, we also contribute to deriving the instance probability under the framework of attention-based MIL, and utilize the derivation to help construct and analyze the proposed framework. The proposed method outperforms other latest methods on the CAMELYON-16 by substantially large margins, and is also better in performance on the TCGA lung cancer dataset. The proposed framework is ready to be extended for wider MIL applications. The code is available at: https://github.com/hrzhang1123/DTFD-MIL</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2022 |
| **[Efficient and generalizable prediction of molecular alterations in multiple cancer cohorts using H&E whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15816v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular testing of tumor samples for targetable biomarkers is restricted by a lack of standardization, turnaround-time, cost, and tissue availability across cancer types. Additionally, targetable alterations of low prevalence may not be tested in routine workflows. Algorithms that predict DNA alterations from routinely generated hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images could prioritize samples for confirmatory molecular testing. Costs and the necessity of a large number of samples containing mutations limit approaches that train individual algorithms for each alteration. In this work, models were trained for simultaneous prediction of multiple DNA alterations from H&E images using a multi-task approach. Compared to biomarker-specific models, this approach performed better on average, with pronounced gains for rare mutations. The models reasonably generalized to independent temporal-holdout, externally-stained, and multi-site TCGA test sets. Additionally, whole slide image embeddings derived using multi-task models demonstrated strong performance in downstream tasks that were not a part of training. Overall, this is a promising approach to develop clinically useful algorithms that provide multiple actionable predictions from a single slide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cell Nuclei Detection and Classification in Whole Slide Images with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06307v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient cell nuclei detection and classification in histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are pivotal for digital pathology applications. Traditional cell segmentation approaches, while commonly used, are computationally expensive and require extensive post-processing, limiting their practicality for high-throughput clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from segmentation to detection for extracting cell information from WSIs, introducing CellNuc-DETR as a more effective solution. We evaluate the accuracy performance of CellNuc-DETR on the PanNuke dataset and conduct cross-dataset evaluations on CoNSeP and MoNuSeg to assess robustness and generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both cell nuclei detection and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of CellNuc-DETR on large WSIs, showing that it not only outperforms current methods in accuracy but also significantly reduces inference times. Specifically, CellNuc-DETR is twice as fast as the fastest segmentation-based method, HoVer-NeXt, while achieving substantially higher accuracy. Moreover, it surpasses CellViT in accuracy and is approximately ten times more efficient in inference speed on WSIs. These results establish CellNuc-DETR as a superior approach for cell analysis in digital pathology, combining high accuracy with computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[An Accelerated Pipeline for Multi-label Renal Pathology Image Segmentation at the Whole Slide Image Level](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14566v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep-learning techniques have been used widely to alleviate the labour-intensive and time-consuming manual annotation required for pixel-level tissue characterization. Our previous study introduced an efficient single dynamic network - Omni-Seg - that achieved multi-class multi-scale pathological segmentation with less computational complexity. However, the patch-wise segmentation paradigm still applies to Omni-Seg, and the pipeline is time-consuming when providing segmentation for Whole Slide Images (WSIs). In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of the Omni-Seg pipeline in order to reduce the repetitive computing processes and utilize a GPU to accelerate the model's prediction for both better model performance and faster speed. Our proposed method's innovative contribution is two-fold: (1) a Docker is released for an end-to-end slide-wise multi-tissue segmentation for WSIs; and (2) the pipeline is deployed on a GPU to accelerate the prediction, achieving better segmentation quality in less time. The proposed accelerated implementation reduced the average processing time (at the testing stage) on a standard needle biopsy WSI from 2.3 hours to 22 minutes, using 35 WSIs from the Kidney Tissue Atlas (KPMP) Datasets. The source code and the Docker have been made publicly available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/Omni-Seg.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoFormer for Position Aware Multiple Instance Learning in Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01924v1)** | 2023-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a critical task in computational pathology. However, the gigapixel-size of such images remains a major challenge for the current state of deep-learning. Current methods rely on multiple-instance learning (MIL) models with frozen feature extractors. Given the the high number of instances in each image, MIL methods have long assumed independence and permutation-invariance of patches, disregarding the tissue structure and correlation between patches. Recent works started studying this correlation between instances but the computational workload of such a high number of tokens remained a limiting factor. In particular, relative position of patches remains unaddressed. We propose to apply a straightforward encoding module, namely a RoFormer layer , relying on memory-efficient exact self-attention and relative positional encoding. This module can perform full self-attention with relative position encoding on patches of large and arbitrary shaped WSIs, solving the need for correlation between instances and spatial modeling of tissues. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MIL models on three commonly used public datasets (TCGA-NSCLC, BRACS and Camelyon16)) on weakly supervised classification tasks.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report in detail how pathologists navigate WSIs of prostate cancer as they accumulate information for their diagnoses. We collected slide navigation data (i.e., viewport location, magnification level, and time) from 13 pathologists in 2 groups (5 genitourinary (GU) specialists and 8 general pathologists) and generated visual attention heatmaps and scanpaths. Each pathologist examined five WSIs from the TCGA PRAD dataset, which were selected by a GU pathology specialist. We examined and analyzed the distributions of visual attention for each group of pathologists after each WSI was examined. To quantify the relationship between a pathologist's attention and evidence for cancer in the WSI, we obtained tumor annotations from a genitourinary specialist. We used these annotations to compute the overlap between the distribution of visual attention and annotated tumor region to identify strong correlations. Motivated by this analysis, we trained a deep learning model to predict visual attention on unseen WSIs. We find that the attention heatmaps predicted by our model correlate quite well with the ground truth attention heatmap and tumor annotations on a test set of 17 WSIs by using various spatial and temporal evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>ISBI ...</summary><p>ISBI 2022 (Oral presentation)</p></details> |

This paper proposes \RV{a new method} for segmenting the Gleason tissues \RV{(patch-wise) in order to grade PCa from the whole slide images (WSI).} Also, the proposed approach encompasses two main contributions: 1) A synergy of hybrid dilation factors and hierarchical decomposition of latent space representation for effective Gleason tissues extraction, and 2) A three-tiered loss function which can penalize different semantic segmentation models for accurately extracting the highly correlated patterns. In addition to this, the proposed framework has been extensively evaluated on a large-scale PCa dataset containing 10,516 whole slide scans (with around 71.7M patches), where it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by 3.22% (in terms of mean intersection-over-union) for extracting the Gleason tissues and 6.91% (in terms of F1 score) for grading the progression of PCa.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE SAS-2021, Source Code is available at https://github.com/taimurhassan/cancer</p></details> |
| **[Handcrafted Histological Transformer (H2T): Unsupervised Representation of Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07001v2)** | 2022-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic decision-making of cancer in pathology clinics can now be carried out based on analysis of multi-gigapixel tissue images, also known as whole-slide images (WSIs). Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to derive unsupervised WSI representations; these are attractive as they rely less on expert annotation which is cumbersome. However, a major trade-off is that higher predictive power generally comes at the cost of interpretability, posing a challenge to their clinical use where transparency in decision-making is generally expected. To address this challenge, we present a handcrafted framework based on deep CNN for constructing holistic WSI-level representations. Building on recent findings about the internal working of the Transformer in the domain of natural language processing, we break down its processes and handcraft them into a more transparent framework that we term as the Handcrafted Histological Transformer or H2T. Based on our experiments involving various datasets consisting of a total of 5,306 WSIs, the results demonstrate that H2T based holistic WSI-level representations offer competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods and can be readily utilized for various downstream analysis tasks. Finally, our results demonstrate that the H2T framework can be up to 14 times faster than the Transformer models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Continual Learning for Whole Slide Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10649v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, domain shift and task discrepancy between datasets can hinder effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a Target-Aware Knowledge Transfer framework, employing a teacher-student paradigm. Our framework enables the teacher model to learn common knowledge from the source and target domains by actively incorporating unlabelled target images into the training of the teacher model. The teacher bag features are subsequently adapted to supervise the training of the student model on the target domain. Despite incorporating the target features during training, the teacher model tends to overlook them under the inherent domain shift and task discrepancy. To alleviate this, we introduce a target-aware feature alignment module to establish a transferable latent relationship between the source and target features by solving the optimal transport problem. Experimental results show that models employing knowledge transfer outperform those trained from scratch, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among other knowledge transfer methods on various datasets, including TCGA-RCC, TCGA-NSCLC, and Camelyon16.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2024</p></details> |

Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches, typically used for the analysis of WSIs, divide the image (bag) into patches (instances), which are used to predict a single bag-level label. These approaches perform poorly in cytopathology slides due to a unique bag structure: sparsely located informative instances with varying characteristics of abnormality. We address these challenges by considering multiple types of labels: bag-level malignancy and ordered diagnostic scores, as well as instance-level informativeness and abnormality labels. We study their contribution beyond the MIL setting by proposing a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework, from which we derive a two-stage deep-learning-based algorithm. The algorithm identifies informative instances and assigns them local malignancy scores that are incorporated into a global malignancy prediction. We derive a lower bound of the MLE, leading to an improved training strategy based on weak supervision, that we motivate through statistical analysis. The lower bound further allows us to extend the proposed algorithm to simultaneously predict multiple bag and instance-level labels from a single output of a neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides competitive performance compared to several competing methods, achieves (expert) human-level performance, and allows augmentation of human decisions.</p></details> |  |

Concentricpatches at multiple resolutions with different fields of view are used to feed different branches of HookNet, and intermediate representations are combined via a hooking mechanism. We describe a framework to design and train HookNet for achieving high-resolution semantic segmentation and introduce constraints to guarantee pixel-wise alignment in feature maps during hooking. We show the advantages of using HookNet in two histopathology image segmentation tasks where tissue type prediction accuracy strongly depends on contextual information, namely (1) multi-class tissue segmentation in breast cancer and, (2) segmentation of tertiary lymphoid structures and germinal centers in lung cancer.

Histology WSIs can have billions of pixels, which create enormous computational and annotation challenges. Typically, such images are divided into a set of patches (a bag of instances), where only bag-level class labels are provided. Deep learning based MIL methods calculate instance features using convolutional neural network (CNN). Our proposed approach is also deep learning based, with the following two contributions: Firstly, we propose to explicitly account for dependencies between instances during training by embedding self-attention Transformer blocks to capture dependencies between instances. For example, a tumor grade may depend on the presence of several particular patterns at different locations in WSI, which requires to account for dependencies between patches. Secondly, we propose an instance-wise loss function based on instance pseudo-labels. We compare the proposed algorithm to multiple baseline methods, evaluate it on the PANDA challenge dataset, the largest publicly available WSI dataset with over 11K images, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | MICCAI 2021 |

However, traditional feature extraction pipelines based on tools like CellProfiler often involve lengthy workflows, requiring WSI segmentation into patches, feature extraction at the patch level, and subsequent mapping back to the original WSI. To address these challenges, we present PySpatial, a high-speed pathomics toolkit specifically designed for WSI-level analysis. PySpatial streamlines the conventional pipeline by directly operating on computational regions of interest, reducing redundant processing steps. Utilizing rtree-based spatial indexing and matrix-based computation, PySpatial efficiently maps and processes computational regions, significantly accelerating feature extraction while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments on two datasets-Perivascular Epithelioid Cell (PEC) and data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)-demonstrate substantial performance improvements. For smaller and sparse objects in PEC datasets, PySpatial achieves nearly a 10-fold speedup compared to standard CellProfiler pipelines. For larger objects, such as glomeruli and arteries in KPMP datasets, PySpatial achieves a 2-fold speedup. These results highlight PySpatial's potential to handle large-scale WSI analysis with enhanced efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for broader applications in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

As pioneering efforts, attention-based MIL (ABMIL) and its variants are increasingly becoming popular due to the characteristics of simultaneously handling clinical diagnosis and tumor localization. However, the attention mechanism exhibits limitations in discriminating between instances, which often misclassifies tissues and potentially impairs MIL performance. This paper proposes an Attribute-Driven MIL (AttriMIL) framework to address these issues. Concretely, we dissect the calculation process of ABMIL and present an attribute scoring mechanism that measures the contribution of each instance to bag prediction effectively, quantifying instance attributes. Based on attribute quantification, we develop a spatial attribute constraint and an attribute ranking constraint to model instance correlations within and across slides, respectively. These constraints encourage the network to capture the spatial correlation and semantic similarity of instances, improving the ability of AttriMIL to distinguish tissue types and identify challenging instances. Additionally, AttriMIL employs a histopathology adaptive backbone that maximizes the pre-trained model's feature extraction capability for collecting pathological features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our AttriMIL outperforms existing state-of-the-art frameworks across multiple evaluation metrics. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MedCAI/AttriMIL.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, in clinical practice, the continuously expanding size of WSI databases limits the practical application of the current CBHIR methods. In this paper, we propose a Lifelong Whole Slide Retrieval (LWSR) framework to address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting by progressive model updating on continuously growing retrieval database. Our framework aims to achieve the balance between stability and plasticity during continuous learning. To preserve system plasticity, we utilize local memory bank with reservoir sampling method to save instances, which can comprehensively encompass the feature spaces of both old and new tasks. Furthermore, A distance consistency rehearsal (DCR) module is designed to ensure the retrieval queue's consistency for previous tasks, which is regarded as stability within a lifelong CBHIR system. We evaluated the proposed method on four public WSI datasets from TCGA projects. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed method is effective and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

It tends to be more difficult to detect by pathologists mainly due to its cellular morphology and diffuse invasion manner, and it has poor prognosis when detected at an advanced stage. Computational pathology tools that can assist pathologists in detecting SRCC would be of a massive benefit. In this paper, we trained deep learning models using transfer learning, fully-supervised learning, and weakly-supervised learning to predict SRCC in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using a training set of 1,765 WSIs. We evaluated the models on four different test sets of about 500 images each. The best model achieved a Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of at least 0.99 on all four test sets, setting a top baseline performance for SRCC WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, 38 pages, 22 figures, 35 tables</p></details> |
| **[EvoPS: Evolutionary Patch Selection for Whole Slide Image Analysis in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07560v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, the gigapixel scale of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates their division into thousands of smaller patches. Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Deep Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis: An Overview](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11097v1)** | 2021-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of whole slide imaging has increased the demand for effective and efficient gigapixel image analysis. Deep learning is at the forefront of computer vision, showcasing significant improvements over previous methodologies on visual understanding. However, whole slide images have billions of pixels and suffer from high morphological heterogeneity as well as from different types of artefacts. Collectively, these impede the conventional use of deep learning. For the clinical translation of deep learning solutions to become a reality, these challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, we review work on the interdisciplinary attempt of training deep neural networks using whole slide images, and highlight the different ideas underlying these methodologies.</p></details> |  |

| **[GloFlow: Global Image Alignment for Creation of Whole Slide Images for Pathology from Video](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15269v2)** | 2020-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of deep learning to pathology assumes the existence of digital whole slide images of pathology slides. However, slide digitization is bottlenecked by the high cost of precise motor stages in slide scanners that are needed for position information used for slide stitching. We propose GloFlow, a two-stage method for creating a whole slide image using optical flow-based image registration with global alignment using a computationally tractable graph-pruning approach. In the first stage, we train an optical flow predictor to predict pairwise translations between successive video frames to approximate a stitch. In the second stage, this approximate stitch is used to create a neighborhood graph to produce a corrected stitch. On a simulated dataset of video scans of WSIs, we find that our method outperforms known approaches to slide-stitching, and stitches WSIs resembling those produced by slide scanners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) at NeurIPS 2020 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |
| **[WISE: A Framework for Gigapixel Whole-Slide-Image Lossless Compression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18074v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) have revolutionized medical analysis by presenting high-resolution images of the whole tissue slide. Despite avoiding the physical storage of the slides, WSIs require considerable data volume, which makes the storage and maintenance of WSI records costly and unsustainable. To this end, this work presents the first investigation of lossless compression of WSI images. Interestingly, we find that most existing compression methods fail to compress the WSI images effectively. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the failure of existing compressors is mainly due to information irregularity in WSI images. To resolve this issue, we developed a simple yet effective lossless compressor called WISE, specifically designed for WSI images. WISE employs a hierarchical encoding strategy to extract effective bits, reducing the entropy of the image and then adopting a dictionary-based method to handle the irregular frequency patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show that WISE can effectively compress the gigapixel WSI images to 36 times on average and up to 136 times.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ink removal from histopathology whole slide images by combining classification, detection and image generation models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04385v1)** | 2019-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slides are routinely marked by pathologists using permanent ink markers that should not be removed as they form part of the medical record. Often tumour regions are marked up for the purpose of highlighting features or other downstream processing such an gene sequencing. Once digitised there is no established method for removing this information from the whole slide images limiting its usability in research and study. Removal of marker ink from these high-resolution whole slide images is non-trivial and complex problem as they contaminate different regions and in an inconsistent manner. We propose an efficient pipeline using convolution neural networks that results in ink-free images without compromising information and image resolution. Our pipeline includes a sequential classical convolution neural network for accurate classification of contaminated image tiles, a fast region detector and a domain adaptive cycle consistent adversarial generative model for restoration of foreground pixels. Both quantitative and qualitative results on four different whole slide images show that our approach yields visually coherent ink-free whole slide images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2019, Venice, Italy</p></details> |

We present new software that enables rapid learn-by-example training of machine learning classifiers for detection of histologic patterns in whole-slide imaging datasets. HistomicsML2.0 uses convolutional networks to be readily adaptable to a variety of applications, provides a web-based user interface, and is available as a software container to simplify deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Learning for Computational Pathology on Gigapixel Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10190v2)** | 2020-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning-based computational pathology algorithms have demonstrated profound ability to excel in a wide array of tasks that range from characterization of well known morphological phenotypes to predicting non-human-identifiable features from histology such as molecular alterations. However, the development of robust, adaptable, and accurate deep learning-based models often rely on the collection and time-costly curation large high-quality annotated training data that should ideally come from diverse sources and patient populations to cater for the heterogeneity that exists in such datasets. Multi-centric and collaborative integration of medical data across multiple institutions can naturally help overcome this challenge and boost the model performance but is limited by privacy concerns amongst other difficulties that may arise in the complex data sharing process as models scale towards using hundreds of thousands of gigapixel whole slide images. In this paper, we introduce privacy-preserving federated learning for gigapixel whole slide images in computational pathology using weakly-supervised attention multiple instance learning and differential privacy. We evaluated our approach on two different diagnostic problems using thousands of histology whole slide images with only slide-level labels. Additionally, we present a weakly-supervised learning framework for survival prediction and patient stratification from whole slide images and demonstrate its effectiveness in a federated setting. Our results show that using federated learning, we can effectively develop accurate weakly supervised deep learning models from distributed data silos without direct data sharing and its associated complexities, while also preserving differential privacy using randomized noise generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparison of Different Methods for Tissue Segmentation in Histopathological Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05990v2)** | 2017-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue segmentation is an important pre-requisite for efficient and accurate diagnostics in digital pathology. However, it is well known that whole-slide scanners can fail in detecting all tissue regions, for example due to the tissue type, or due to weak staining because their tissue detection algorithms are not robust enough. In this paper, we introduce two different convolutional neural network architectures for whole slide image segmentation to accurately identify the tissue sections. We also compare the algorithms to a published traditional method. We collected 54 whole slide images with differing stains and tissue types from three laboratories to validate our algorithms. We show that while the two methods do not differ significantly they outperform their traditional counterpart (Jaccard index of 0.937 and 0.929 vs. 0.870, p < 0.01).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017</p></details> |
| **[SparseConvMIL: Sparse Convolutional Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02726v2)** | 2021-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the preferred approach for whole slide image classification. However, most MIL approaches do not exploit the interdependencies of tiles extracted from a whole slide image, which could provide valuable cues for classification. This paper presents a novel MIL approach that exploits the spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole slide images. To do so, a sparse map is built from tiles embeddings, and is then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art performance over popular MIL approaches on the classification of cancer subtype involving 10000 whole slide images. Our results suggest that the proposed approach might (i) improve the representation learning of instances and (ii) exploit the context of instance embeddings to enhance the classification performance. The code of this work is open-source at {github censored for review}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tissue Concepts v2: A Supervised Foundation Model For Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05742v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) are transforming the field of computational pathology by offering new approaches to analyzing histopathology images. Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Representing Whole Slide Cancer Image Features with Hilbert Curves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06469v1)** | 2020-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regions of Interest (ROI) contain morphological features in pathology whole slide images (WSI) are delimited with polygons[1]. These polygons are often represented in either a textual notation (with the array of edges) or in a binary mask form. Textual notations have an advantage of human readability and portability, whereas, binary mask representations are more useful as the input and output of feature-extraction pipelines that employ deep learning methodologies. For any given whole slide image, more than a million cellular features can be segmented generating a corresponding number of polygons. The corpus of these segmentations for all processed whole slide images creates various challenges for filtering specific areas of data for use in interactive real-time and multi-scale displays and analysis. Simple range queries of image locations do not scale and, instead, spatial indexing schemes are required. In this paper we propose using Hilbert Curves simultaneously for spatial indexing and as a polygonal ROI representation. This is achieved by using a series of Hilbert Curves[2] creating an efficient and inherently spatially-indexed machine-usable form. The distinctive property of Hilbert curves that enables both mask and polygon delimitation of ROIs is that the elements of the vector extracted ro describe morphological features maintain their relative positions for different scales of the same image.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Region of Interest Detection in Melanocytic Skin Tumor Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16457v1)** | 2022-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated region of interest detection in histopathological image analysis is a challenging and important topic with tremendous potential impact on clinical practice. The deep-learning methods used in computational pathology help us to reduce costs and increase the speed and accuracy of regions of interest detection and cancer diagnosis. In this work, we propose a patch-based region of interest detection method for melanocytic skin tumor whole-slide images. We work with a dataset that contains 165 primary melanomas and nevi Hematoxylin and Eosin whole-slide images and build a deep-learning method. The proposed method performs well on a hold-out test data set including five TCGA-SKCM slides (accuracy of 93.94\% in slide classification task and intersection over union rate of 41.27\% in the region of interest detection task), showing the outstanding performance of our model on melanocytic skin tumor. Even though we test the experiments on the skin tumor dataset, our work could also be extended to other medical image detection problems, such as various tumors' classification and prediction, to help and benefit the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of different tumors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MedNeurIPS 2022</p></details> |
| **[Overcoming the limitations of patch-based learning to detect cancer in whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00617v1)** | 2020-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) pose unique challenges when training deep learning models. They are very large which makes it necessary to break each image down into smaller patches for analysis, image features have to be extracted at multiple scales in order to capture both detail and context, and extreme class imbalances may exist. Significant progress has been made in the analysis of these images, thanks largely due to the availability of public annotated datasets. We postulate, however, that even if a method scores well on a challenge task, this success may not translate to good performance in a more clinically relevant workflow. Many datasets consist of image patches which may suffer from data curation bias; other datasets are only labelled at the whole slide level and the lack of annotations across an image may mask erroneous local predictions so long as the final decision is correct. In this paper, we outline the differences between patch or slide-level classification versus methods that need to localize or segment cancer accurately across the whole slide, and we experimentally verify that best practices differ in both cases. We apply a binary cancer detection network on post neoadjuvant therapy breast cancer WSIs to find the tumor bed outlining the extent of cancer, a task which requires sensitivity and precision across the whole slide. We extensively study multiple design choices and their effects on the outcome, including architectures and augmentations. Furthermore, we propose a negative data sampling strategy, which drastically reduces the false positive rate (7% on slide level) and improves each metric pertinent to our problem, with a 15% reduction in the error of tumor extent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Regional Registration of Whole Slide Image Stacks Containing Highly Deformed Artefacts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12588v1)** | 2020-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation: High resolution 2D whole slide imaging provides rich information about the tissue structure. This information can be a lot richer if these 2D images can be stacked into a 3D tissue volume. A 3D analysis, however, requires accurate reconstruction of the tissue volume from the 2D image stack. This task is not trivial due to the distortions that each individual tissue slice experiences while cutting and mounting the tissue on the glass slide. Performing registration for the whole tissue slices may be adversely affected by the deformed tissue regions. Consequently, regional registration is found to be more effective. In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust regional registration algorithm for whole slide images which incrementally focuses registration on the area around the region of interest. Results: Using mean similarity index as the metric, the proposed algorithm (mean $\pm$ std: $0.84 \pm 0.11$) followed by a fine registration algorithm ($0.86 \pm 0.08$) outperformed the state-of-the-art linear whole tissue registration algorithm ($0.74 \pm 0.19$) and the regional version of this algorithm ($0.81 \pm 0.15$). The proposed algorithm also outperforms the state-of-the-art nonlinear registration algorithm (original : $0.82 \pm 0.12$, regional : $0.77 \pm 0.22$) for whole slide images and a recently proposed patch-based registration algorithm (patch size 256: $0.79 \pm 0.16$ , patch size 512: $0.77 \pm 0.16$) for medical images. Availability: The C++ implementation code is available online at the github repository: https://github.com/MahsaPaknezhad/WSIRegistration</p></details> |  |
| **[Tissue Artifact Segmentation and Severity Analysis for Automated Diagnosis Using Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01386v3)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, pathological analysis and diagnosis are performed by manually eyeballing glass slide specimens under a microscope by an expert. The whole slide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide image enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to computational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are utilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data. Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity automatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity evaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The proposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of six fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This method outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for artifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the evaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the system was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical usability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis, 60 pages, 21 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Whole-Slide Image Focus Quality: Automatic Assessment and Impact on AI Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.04619v2)** | 2020-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology enables remote access or consults and powerful image analysis algorithms. However, the slide digitization process can create artifacts such as out-of-focus (OOF). OOF is often only detected upon careful review, potentially causing rescanning and workflow delays. Although scan-time operator screening for whole-slide OOF is feasible, manual screening for OOF affecting only parts of a slide is impractical. We developed a convolutional neural network (ConvFocus) to exhaustively localize and quantify the severity of OOF regions on digitized slides. ConvFocus was developed using our refined semi-synthetic OOF data generation process, and evaluated using real whole-slide images spanning 3 different tissue types and 3 different stain types that were digitized by two different scanners. ConvFocus's predictions were compared with pathologist-annotated focus quality grades across 514 distinct regions representing 37,700 35x35 $μ$m image patches, and 21 digitized "z-stack" whole-slide images that contain known OOF patterns. When compared to pathologist-graded focus quality, ConvFocus achieved Spearman rank coefficients of 0.81 and 0.94 on two scanners, and reproduced the expected OOF patterns from z-stack scanning. We also evaluated the impact of OOF on the accuracy of a state-of-the-art metastatic breast cancer detector and saw a consistent decrease in performance with increasing OOF. Comprehensive whole-slide OOF categorization could enable rescans prior to pathologist review, potentially reducing the impact of digitization focus issues on the clinical workflow. We show that the algorithm trained on our semi-synthetic OOF data generalizes well to real OOF regions across tissue types, stains, and scanners. Finally, quantitative OOF maps can flag regions that might otherwise be misclassified by image analysis algorithms, preventing OOF-induced errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic labeling of molecular biomarkers of whole slide immunohistochemistry images using fully convolutional networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09420v1)** | 2017-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of quantifying biomarkers in multi-stained tissues, based on color and spatial information. A deep learning based method that can automatically localize and quantify the cells expressing biomarker(s) in a whole slide image is proposed. The deep learning network is a fully convolutional network (FCN) whose input is the true RGB color image of a tissue and output is a map of the different biomarkers. The FCN relies on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies each cell separately according to the biomarker it expresses. In this study, images of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides were collected and used. More than 4,500 RGB images of cells were manually labeled based on the expressing biomarkers. The labeled cell images were used to train the CNN (obtaining an accuracy of 92% in a test set). The trained CNN is then extended to an FCN that generates a map of all biomarkers in the whole slide image acquired by the scanner (instead of classifying every cell image). To evaluate our method, we manually labeled all nuclei expressing different biomarkers in two whole slide images and used theses as the ground truth. Our proposed method for immunohistochemical analysis compares well with the manual labeling by humans (average F-score of 0.96).</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying regions of interest in whole slide images of renal cell carcinoma](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07313v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological images contain a huge amount of information, which can make diagnosis an extremely timeconsuming and tedious task. In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clustered Patch Embeddings for Permutation-Invariant Classification of Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08936v1)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is a cornerstone of digital pathology, offering detailed insights critical for diagnosis and research. Yet, the gigapixel size of WSIs imposes significant computational challenges, limiting their practical utility. Our novel approach addresses these challenges by leveraging various encoders for intelligent data reduction and employing a different classification model to ensure robust, permutation-invariant representations of WSIs. A key innovation of our method is the ability to distill the complex information of an entire WSI into a single vector, effectively capturing the essential features needed for accurate analysis. This approach significantly enhances the computational efficiency of WSI analysis, enabling more accurate pathological assessments without the need for extensive computational resources. This breakthrough equips us with the capability to effectively address the challenges posed by large image resolutions in whole-slide imaging, paving the way for more scalable and effective utilization of WSIs in medical diagnostics and research, marking a significant advancement in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.08530</p></details> |
| **[Improving Quality Control of Whole Slide Images by Explicit Artifact Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11538v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of artifacts in whole slide image acquisition, prevalent in both clinical workflows and research-oriented settings, necessitates human intervention and re-scanning. Overcoming this challenge requires developing quality control algorithms, that are hindered by the limited availability of relevant annotated data in histopathology. The manual annotation of ground-truth for artifact detection methods is expensive and time-consuming. This work addresses the issue by proposing a method dedicated to augmenting whole slide images with artifacts. The tool seamlessly generates and blends artifacts from an external library to a given histopathology dataset. The augmented datasets are then utilized to train artifact classification methods. The evaluation shows their usefulness in classification of the artifacts, where they show an improvement from 0.10 to 0.01 AUROC depending on the artifact type. The framework, model, weights, and ground-truth annotations are freely released to facilitate open science and reproducible research.</p></details> |  |
| **[WSI-VQA: Interpreting Whole Slide Images by Generative Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05603v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide imaging is routinely adopted for carcinoma diagnosis and prognosis. Abundant experience is required for pathologists to achieve accurate and reliable diagnostic results of whole slide images (WSI). The huge size and heterogeneous features of WSIs make the workflow of pathological reading extremely time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (WSI-VQA) to interpret WSIs by generative visual question answering. WSI-VQA shows universality by reframing various kinds of slide-level tasks in a question-answering pattern, in which pathologists can achieve immunohistochemical grading, survival prediction, and tumor subtyping following human-machine interaction. Furthermore, we establish a WSI-VQA dataset which contains 8672 slide-level question-answering pairs with 977 WSIs. Besides the ability to deal with different slide-level tasks, our generative model which is named Wsi2Text Transformer (W2T) outperforms existing discriminative models in medical correctness, which reveals the potential of our model to be applied in the clinical scenario. Additionally, we also visualize the co-attention mapping between word embeddings and WSIs as an intuitive explanation for diagnostic results. The dataset and related code are available at https://github.com/cpystan/WSI-VQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |
| **[Data Efficient and Weakly Supervised Computational Pathology on Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09666v2)** | 2020-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapidly emerging field of computational pathology has the potential to enable objective diagnosis, therapeutic response prediction and identification of new morphological features of clinical relevance. However, deep learning-based computational pathology approaches either require manual annotation of gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in fully-supervised settings or thousands of WSIs with slide-level labels in a weakly-supervised setting. Moreover, whole slide level computational pathology methods also suffer from domain adaptation and interpretability issues. These challenges have prevented the broad adaptation of computational pathology for clinical and research purposes. Here we present CLAM - Clustering-constrained attention multiple instance learning, an easy-to-use, high-throughput, and interpretable WSI-level processing and learning method that only requires slide-level labels while being data efficient, adaptable and capable of handling multi-class subtyping problems. CLAM is a deep-learning-based weakly-supervised method that uses attention-based learning to automatically identify sub-regions of high diagnostic value in order to accurately classify the whole slide, while also utilizing instance-level clustering over the representative regions identified to constrain and refine the feature space. In three separate analyses, we demonstrate the data efficiency and adaptability of CLAM and its superior performance over standard weakly-supervised classification. We demonstrate that CLAM models are interpretable and can be used to identify well-known and new morphological features. We further show that models trained using CLAM are adaptable to independent test cohorts, cell phone microscopy images, and biopsies. CLAM is a general-purpose and adaptable method that can be used for a variety of different computational pathology tasks in both clinical and research settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedWSIDD: Federated Whole Slide Image Classification via Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15365v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Automatic Multi-Stain Registration of Whole Slide Images in Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14292v1)** | 2022-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint analysis of multiple biomarker images and tissue morphology is important for disease diagnosis, treatment planning and drug development. It requires cross-staining comparison among Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of immuno-histochemical and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) microscopic slides. However, automatic, and fast cross-staining alignment of enormous gigapixel WSIs at single-cell precision is challenging. In addition to morphological deformations introduced during slide preparation, there are large variations in cell appearance and tissue morphology across different staining. In this paper, we propose a two-step automatic feature-based cross-staining WSI alignment to assist localization of even tiny metastatic foci in the assessment of lymph node. Image pairs were aligned allowing for translation, rotation, and scaling. The registration was performed automatically by first detecting landmarks in both images, using the scale-invariant image transform (SIFT), followed by the fast sample consensus (FSC) protocol for finding point correspondences and finally aligned the images. The Registration results were evaluated using both visual and quantitative criteria using the Jaccard index. The average Jaccard similarity index of the results produced by the proposed system is 0.942 when compared with the manual registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMBC 2021 : 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Classification of Prostate Histopathology Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.01357v2)** | 2018-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic and accurate Gleason grading of histopathology tissue slides is crucial for prostate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Usually, histopathology tissue slides from different institutions show heterogeneous appearances because of different tissue preparation and staining procedures, thus the predictable model learned from one domain may not be applicable to a new domain directly. Here we propose to adopt unsupervised domain adaptation to transfer the discriminative knowledge obtained from the source domain to the target domain without requiring labeling of images at the target domain. The adaptation is achieved through adversarial training to find an invariant feature space along with the proposed Siamese architecture on the target domain to add a regularization that is appropriate for the whole-slide images. We validate the method on two prostate cancer datasets and obtain significant classification improvement of Gleason scores as compared with the baseline models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2018</p></details> |

With sWSI, most mainstream smartphone connected to a optical eyepiece of any manually controlled microscope can be automatically controlled to capture sequences of mega-pixel fields of views that are synthesized into giga-pixel virtual slides. Remote servers carry out the majority of computation asynchronously to support clients running at satisfying frame rates without sacrificing image quality nor robustness. A typical 15x15mm sample can be digitized in 30 seconds with 4X or in 3 minutes with 10X object magnification, costing under $1. The virtual slide quality is considered comparable to existing high-end scanners thus satisfying for clinical usage by surveyed pathologies. The scan procedure with features such as supporting magnification up to 100x, recoding z-stacks, specimen-type-neutral and giving real-time feedback, is deemed work-flow-friendly and reliable.</p></details> |  |
| **[WsiCaption: Multiple Instance Generation of Pathology Reports for Gigapixel Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16480v4)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images are the foundation of digital pathology for the diagnosis and treatment of carcinomas. Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |

It allows one to perform the preprocessing, initial alignment, and nonrigid registration of WSIs acquired using multiple stains (e.g. hematoxylin \& eosin, immunochemistry). The framework implements several state-of-the-art registration algorithms and provides an interface to operate on arbitrary resolution of the WSIs (up to 200k x 200k).

A projected increase in skin cancer incidents and a dearth of dermatopathologists have emphasized the need for computational pathology (CPATH) systems. CPATH systems with deep learning (DL) models have the potential to identify the presence of melanoma by exploiting underlying morphological and cellular features. This paper proposes a DL method to detect melanoma and distinguish between normal skin and benign/malignant melanocytic lesions in Whole Slide Images (WSI). Our method detects lesions with high accuracy and localizes them on a WSI to identify potential regions of interest for pathologists. Interestingly, our DL method relies on using a single CNN network to create localization maps first and use them to perform slide-level predictions to determine patients who have melanoma. Our best model provides favorable patch-wise classification results with a 0.992 F1 score and 0.99 sensitivity on unseen data.

| **[Automated Whole Slide Imaging for Label-Free Histology using Photon Absorption Remote Sensing Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.13736v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of histology relies heavily on antiquated tissue processing and staining techniques that limit the efficiency of pathologic diagnoses of cancer and other diseases. Current staining and advanced labeling methods are often destructive and mutually incompatible, requiring new tissue sections for each stain. This prolongs the diagnostic process and depletes valuable biopsy samples. In this study, we present an alternative label-free histology platform using the first transmission-mode Photon Absorption Remote Sensing microscope. Optimized for automated whole slide scanning of unstained tissue samples, the system provides slide images at magnifications up to 40x that are fully compatible with existing digital pathology tools. The scans capture high quality and high-resolution images with subcellular diagnostic detail. After imaging, samples remain suitable for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and other staining techniques. Scattering and absorption (radiative and non-radiative) contrasts are shown in whole slide images of malignant human breast and skin tissues samples. Clinically relevant features are highlighted, and close correspondence and analogous contrast is demonstrated with one-to-one gold standard H&E stained images. Our previously reported pix2pix virtual staining model is applied to an entire whole slide image, showcasing the potential of this approach in whole slide label-free H&E emulation. This work is a critical advance for integrating label-free optical methods into standard histopathology workflows, both enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and broadening the number of stains that can be applied while preserving valuable tissue samples.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Deep-Learning for Classification of Colorectal Polyps on Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01550v2)** | 2017-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients. This characterization is time-intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from significant inter-observer and intra-observer variability. In this work, we built an automatic image-understanding method that can accurately classify different types of colorectal polyps in whole-slide histology images to help pathologists with histopathological characterization and diagnosis of colorectal polyps. The proposed image-understanding method is based on deep-learning techniques, which rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and have shown state-of-the-art results for various image analysis tasks. Our image-understanding method covers all five polyp types (hyperplastic polyp, sessile serrated polyp, traditional serrated adenoma, tubular adenoma, and tubulovillous/villous adenoma) that are included in the US multi-society task force guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment and surveillance, and encompasses the most common occurrences of colorectal polyps. Our evaluation on 239 independent test samples shows our proposed method can identify the types of colorectal polyps in whole-slide images with a high efficacy (accuracy: 93.0%, precision: 89.7%, recall: 88.3%, F1 score: 88.8%). The presented method in this paper can reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps, and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations.</p></details> |  |

However, in order to obtain good performance, these research achievements rely on hundreds of well-annotated WSIs. In this study, we tackle the tumor localization and detection problem under the setting of few labeled whole slide images and introduce a patch-based analysis pipeline based on the latest reverse knowledge distillation architecture. To address the extremely unbalanced normal and tumorous samples in training sample collection, we applied the focal loss formula to the representation similarity metric for model optimization. Compared with prior arts, our method achieves similar performance by less than ten percent of training samples on the public Camelyon16 dataset. In addition, this is the first work that show the great potential of the knowledge distillation models in computational histopathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, 1 appendix</p></details> |

However, its application has been limited by low throughput and the need for specialized experimental facilities. Prior works sought to predict ST from whole-slide histology images to accelerate this process, but they suffer from two major limitations. First, they do not explicitly model cell-cell interaction as they factorize the joint distribution of whole-slide ST data and predict the gene expression of each spot independently. Second, their encoders struggle with memory constraints due to the large number of spots (often exceeding 10,000) in typical ST datasets. Herein, we propose STFlow, a flow matching generative model that considers cell-cell interaction by modeling the joint distribution of gene expression of an entire slide. It also employs an efficient slide-level encoder with local spatial attention, enabling whole-slide processing without excessive memory overhead. On the recently curated HEST-1k and STImage-1K4M benchmarks, STFlow substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves over 18% relative improvements over the pathology foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cascaded Cross-Attention Networks for Data-Efficient Whole-Slide Image Classification Using Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.06963v1)** | 2023-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-Slide Imaging allows for the capturing and digitization of high-resolution images of histological specimen. An automated analysis of such images using deep learning models is therefore of high demand. The transformer architecture has been proposed as a possible candidate for effectively leveraging the high-resolution information. Here, the whole-slide image is partitioned into smaller image patches and feature tokens are extracted from these image patches. However, while the conventional transformer allows for a simultaneous processing of a large set of input tokens, the computational demand scales quadratically with the number of input tokens and thus quadratically with the number of image patches. To address this problem we propose a novel cascaded cross-attention network (CCAN) based on the cross-attention mechanism that scales linearly with the number of extracted patches. Our experiments demonstrate that this architecture is at least on-par with and even outperforms other attention-based state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets: On the use-case of lung cancer (TCGA NSCLC) our model reaches a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.970 $\pm$ 0.008 and on renal cancer (TCGA RCC) reaches a mean AUC of 0.985 $\pm$ 0.004. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is efficient in low-data regimes, making it a promising approach for analyzing whole-slide images in resource-limited settings. To foster research in this direction, we make our code publicly available on GitHub: XXX.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11761v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB).

| **[PATHS: A Hierarchical Transformer for Efficient Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18225v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational analysis of whole slide images (WSIs) has seen significant research progress in recent years, with applications ranging across important diagnostic and prognostic tasks such as survival or cancer subtype prediction. Many state-of-the-art models process the entire slide - which may be as large as $150,000 \times 150,000$ pixels - as a bag of many patches, the size of which necessitates computationally cheap feature aggregation methods. However, a large proportion of these patches are uninformative, such as those containing only healthy or adipose tissue, adding significant noise and size to the bag. We propose Pathology Transformer with Hierarchical Selection (PATHS), a novel top-down method for hierarchical weakly supervised representation learning on slide-level tasks in computational pathology. PATHS is inspired by the cross-magnification manner in which a human pathologist examines a slide, recursively filtering patches at each magnification level to a small subset relevant to the diagnosis. Our method overcomes the complications of processing the entire slide, enabling quadratic self-attention and providing a simple interpretable measure of region importance. We apply PATHS to five datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and achieve superior performance on slide-level prediction tasks when compared to previous methods, despite processing only a small proportion of the slide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Pathology Feature Extractors for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11772v5)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised whole slide image classification is a key task in computational pathology, which involves predicting a slide-level label from a set of image patches constituting the slide. Constructing models to solve this task involves multiple design choices, often made without robust empirical or conclusive theoretical justification. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of feature extractors to answer three critical questions: 1) Is stain normalisation still a necessary preprocessing step? 2) Which feature extractors are best for downstream slide-level classification? 3) How does magnification affect downstream performance? Our study constitutes the most comprehensive evaluation of publicly available pathology feature extractors to date, involving more than 10,000 training runs across 14 feature extractors, 9 tasks, 5 datasets, 3 downstream architectures, 2 levels of magnification, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings challenge existing assumptions: 1) We observe empirically, and by analysing the latent space, that skipping stain normalisation and image augmentations does not degrade performance, while significantly reducing memory and computational demands. 2) We develop a novel evaluation metric to compare relative downstream performance, and show that the choice of feature extractor is the most consequential factor for downstream performance. 3) We find that lower-magnification slides are sufficient for accurate slide-level classification. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level biomarker prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors.</p></details> | <details><summary>For t...</summary><p>For the conference version see: arXiv:2311.11772v4.

However, due to the large scale of WSIs and various sizes of the abnormal area, how to select informative regions and analyze them are quite challenging during the automatic diagnosis process. The multi-instance learning based on the most discriminative instances can be of great benefit for whole slide gastric image diagnosis. In this paper, we design a recalibrated multi-instance deep learning method (RMDL) to address this challenging problem. We first select the discriminative instances, and then utilize these instances to diagnose diseases based on the proposed RMDL approach. The designed RMDL network is capable of capturing instance-wise dependencies and recalibrating instance features according to the importance coefficient learned from the fused features. Furthermore, we build a large whole-slide gastric histopathology image dataset with detailed pixel-level annotations. Experimental results on the constructed gastric dataset demonstrate the significant improvement on the accuracy of our proposed framework compared with other state-of-the-art multi-instance learning methods. Moreover, our method is general and can be extended to other diagnosis tasks of different cancer types based on WSIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Medical Image Analysis.

| **[Region-guided CycleGANs for Stain Transfer in Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12847v1)** | 2022-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In whole slide imaging, commonly used staining techniques based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains accentuate different aspects of the tissue landscape. In the case of detecting metastases, IHC provides a distinct readout that is readily interpretable by pathologists. IHC, however, is a more expensive approach and not available at all medical centers. Virtually generating IHC images from H&E using deep neural networks thus becomes an attractive alternative. Deep generative models such as CycleGANs learn a semantically-consistent mapping between two image domains, while emulating the textural properties of each domain. They are therefore a suitable choice for stain transfer applications. However, they remain fully unsupervised, and possess no mechanism for enforcing biological consistency in stain transfer. In this paper, we propose an extension to CycleGANs in the form of a region of interest discriminator. This allows the CycleGAN to learn from unpaired datasets where, in addition, there is a partial annotation of objects for which one wishes to enforce consistency. We present a use case on whole slide images, where an IHC stain provides an experimentally generated signal for metastatic cells. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach over prior art in stain transfer on histopathology tiles over two datasets. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/jcboyd/miccai2022-roigan.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoration of marker occluded hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide histology images using generative adversarial networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06428v1)** | 2019-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is common for pathologists to annotate specific regions of the tissue, such as tumor, directly on the glass slide with markers. Although this practice was helpful prior to the advent of histology whole slide digitization, it often occludes important details which are increasingly relevant to immuno-oncology due to recent advancements in digital pathology imaging techniques. The current work uses a generative adversarial network with cycle loss to remove these annotations while still maintaining the underlying structure of the tissue by solving an image-to-image translation problem. We train our network on up to 300 whole slide images with marker inks and show that 70% of the corrected image patches are indistinguishable from originally uncontaminated image tissue to a human expert. This portion increases 97% when we replace the human expert with a deep residual network. We demonstrated the fidelity of the method to the original image by calculating the correlation between image gradient magnitudes. We observed a revival of up to 94,000 nuclei per slide in our dataset, the majority of which were located on tissue border.</p></details> |  |

Current methods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for satisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable computational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance due to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy architecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that mitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual few-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored for pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with the tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse transformers, to date.

However, it is much more challenging than natural optical image segmentation due to the high-resolution of medical images and the corresponding huge computation cost. The sliding window is a commonly used technique for whole slide image (WSI) segmentation, however, for these methods based on the sliding window, the main drawback is lacking global contextual information for supervision. In this paper, we propose a dual-inputs attention network (denoted as DA-RefineNet) for WSI segmentation, where both local fine-grained information and global coarse information can be efficiently utilized. Sufficient comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results prove that the proposed method can achieve better performance on WSI segmentation compared to methods relying on single-input.</p></details> |  |

However, generating such detailed annotation is often costly, whereas the coarse annotations are relatively simpler to produce. Existing methods for refining coarse annotations often rely on extensive training samples or clean datasets, and fail to capture both intra-slide and inter-slide latent sematic patterns, limiting their precision. In this paper, we propose a prototype-guided approach. Specifically, we introduce a local-to-global approach to construct non-redundant representative prototypes by jointly modeling intra-slide local semantics and inter-slide contextual relationships. Then a prototype-guided pseudo-labeling module is proposed for refining coarse annotations. Finally, we employ dynamic data sampling and re-finetuning strategy to train a patch classifier. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets, covering lymph, liver, and colorectal cancers, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

As one of the most recent applications, deep models have also been used to extract molecular features from whole slide images. Although molecular tests carry rich information, they are often expensive, time-consuming, and require additional tissue to sample. In this paper, we propose tRNAsfomer, an attention-based topology that can learn both to predict the bulk RNA-seq from an image and represent the whole slide image of a glass slide simultaneously. The tRNAsfomer uses multiple instance learning to solve a weakly supervised problem while the pixel-level annotation is not available for an image. We conducted several experiments and achieved better performance and faster convergence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed tRNAsfomer can assist as a computational pathology tool to facilitate a new generation of search and classification methods by combining the tissue morphology and the molecular fingerprint of the biopsy samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathAlign: A vision-language model for whole slide images in histopathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19578v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages and 19 pages of supplemental material; 3 main tables, 3 main figures and 11 supplemental tables, 7 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Whole-slide imaging which is a method of scanning glass slides have been employed for diagnosis of HCC. Using high resolution Whole-slide images is infeasible for Convolutional Neural Network applications. Hence tiling the Whole-slide images is a common methodology for assigning Convolutional Neural Networks for classification and segmentation. Determination of the tile size affects the performance of the algorithms since small field of view can not capture the information on a larger scale and large field of view can not capture the information on a cellular scale. In this work, the effect of tile size on performance for classification problem is analysed. In addition, Multi Field of View CNN is assigned for taking advantage of the information provided by different tile sizes and Attention CNN is assigned for giving the capability of voting most contributing tile size. It is found that employing more than one tile size significantly increases the performance of the classification by 3.97% and both algorithms are found successful over the algorithm which uses only one tile size.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been withdrawn by the authors due to need for heavy revise</p></details> |

Virtual staining from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) allows the automatic production of other useful IHC stains without the expensive physical staining process. However, current virtual WSI generation methods based on tile-wise processing often suffer from inconsistencies in content, texture, and color at tile boundaries. These inconsistencies lead to artifacts that compromise image quality and potentially hinder accurate clinical assessment and diagnoses. To address this limitation, we propose a novel consistent WSI synthesis network, CC-WSI-Net, that extends GAN models to produce seamless synthetic whole slide images. Our CC-WSI-Net integrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency across tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while ensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We validate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective detection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists. By generating high-quality synthetic WSIs, our method opens doors for advanced virtual staining techniques with broader applications in research and clinical care.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Mamba for Efficient Whole Slide Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17457v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |

It is unclear, however, how the current WSI registration methods would perform on a real-world data set. AutomatiC Registration Of Breast cAncer Tissue (ACROBAT) challenge is held to verify the performance of the current WSI registration methods by using a new dataset that originates from routine diagnostics to assess real-world applicability. In this report, we present our solution for the ACROBAT challenge. We employ a two-step approach including rigid and non-rigid transforms. The experimental results show that the median 90th percentile is 1,250 um for the validation dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computer-aided Detection of Squamous Carcinoma of the Cervix in Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10959v1)** | 2019-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal: Squamous cell carcinoma of cervix is one of the most prevalent cancer worldwide in females. Traditionally, the most indispensable diagnosis of cervix squamous carcinoma is histopathological assessment which is achieved under microscope by pathologist. However, human evaluation of pathology slide is highly depending on the experience of pathologist, thus big inter- and intra-observer variability exists. Digital pathology, in combination with deep learning provides an opportunity to improve the objectivity and efficiency of histopathologic slide analysis. Methods: In this study, we obtained 800 haematoxylin and eosin stained slides from 300 patients suffered from cervix squamous carcinoma. Based on information from morphological heterogeneity in the tumor and its adjacent area, we established deep learning models using popular convolution neural network architectures (inception-v3, InceptionResnet-v2 and Resnet50). Then random forest was introduced to feature extractions and slide-based classification. Results: The overall performance of our proposed models on slide-based tumor discrimination were outstanding with an AUC scores > 0.94. While, location identifications of lesions in whole slide images were mediocre (FROC scores > 0.52) duo to the extreme complexity of tumor tissues. Conclusion: For the first time, our analysis workflow highlighted a quantitative visual-based slide analysis of cervix squamous carcinoma. Significance: This study demonstrates a pathway to assist pathologist and accelerate the diagnosis of patients by utilizing new computational approaches.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5figures |
| **[Trusted Multi-Scale Classification Framework for Whole Slide Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05290v1)** | 2022-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite remarkable efforts been made, the classification of gigapixels whole-slide image (WSI) is severely restrained from either the constrained computing resources for the whole slides, or limited utilizing of the knowledge from different scales. Moreover, most of the previous attempts lacked of the ability of uncertainty estimation. Generally, the pathologists often jointly analyze WSI from the different magnifications. If the pathologists are uncertain by using single magnification, then they will change the magnification repeatedly to discover various features of the tissues. Motivated by the diagnose process of the pathologists, in this paper, we propose a trusted multi-scale classification framework for the WSI. Leveraging the Vision Transformer as the backbone for multi branches, our framework can jointly classification modeling, estimating the uncertainty of each magnification of a microscope and integrate the evidence from different magnification. Moreover, to exploit discriminative patches from WSIs and reduce the requirement for computation resources, we propose a novel patch selection schema using attention rollout and non-maximum suppression. To empirically investigate the effectiveness of our approach, empirical experiments are conducted on our WSI classification tasks, using two benchmark databases. The obtained results suggest that the trusted framework can significantly improve the WSI classification performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Pipeline for Glomerulus Whole-Slide Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04782v2)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSI) glomerulus segmentation is essential for accurately diagnosing kidney diseases. In this work, we propose a general and practical pipeline for glomerulus segmentation that effectively enhances both patch-level and WSI-level segmentation tasks. Our approach leverages stitching on overlapping patches, increasing the detection coverage, especially when glomeruli are located near patch image borders. In addition, we conduct comprehensive evaluations from different segmentation models across two large and diverse datasets with over 30K glomerulus annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that models using our pipeline outperform the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving superior results across both datasets and setting a new benchmark for glomerulus segmentation in WSIs.

The previous representation learning methods followed the supervised learning paradigm. However, manual annotation for large-scale WSIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Hence, the self-supervised contrastive learning has recently attracted intensive attention. The present contrastive learning methods treat each sample as a single class, which suffers from class collision problems, especially in the domain of histopathology image analysis. In this paper, we proposed a novel contrastive representation learning framework named Lesion-Aware Contrastive Learning (LACL) for histopathology whole slide image analysis. We built a lesion queue based on the memory bank structure to store the representations of different classes of WSIs, which allowed the contrastive model to selectively define the negative pairs during the training. Moreover, We designed a queue refinement strategy to purify the representations stored in the lesion queue. The experimental results demonstrate that LACL achieves the best performance in histopathology image representation learning on different datasets, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under different WSI classification benchmarks.

| **[DPsurv: Dual-Prototype Evidential Fusion for Uncertainty-Aware and Interpretable Whole-Slide Image Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00053v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) are widely used for cancer survival analysis because of their comprehensive histopathological information at both cellular and tissue levels, enabling quantitative, large-scale, and prognostically rich tumor feature analysis. However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Rapid Diagnosis of Whole Slide Pathological Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.02850v1)** | 2022-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deep neural network is a research hotspot for histopathological image analysis, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis for pathologists or be used for disease screening. The whole slide pathological image can reach one gigapixel and contains abundant tissue feature information, which needs to be divided into a lot of patches in the training and inference stages. This will lead to a long convergence time and large memory consumption. Furthermore, well-annotated data sets are also in short supply in the field of digital pathology. Inspired by the pathologist's clinical diagnosis process, we propose a weakly supervised deep reinforcement learning framework, which can greatly reduce the time required for network inference. We use neural network to construct the search model and decision model of reinforcement learning agent respectively. The search model predicts the next action through the image features of different magnifications in the current field of view, and the decision model is used to return the predicted probability of the current field of view image. In addition, an expert-guided model is constructed by multi-instance learning, which not only provides rewards for search model, but also guides decision model learning by the knowledge distillation method. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve fast inference and accurate prediction of whole slide images without any pixel-level annotations.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 3figures, published to ACM Digital Library</p></details> |
| **[FALFormer: Feature-aware Landmarks self-attention for Whole-slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07340v2)** | 2024-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slide-level classification for whole-slide images (WSIs) has been widely recognized as a crucial problem in digital and computational pathology. Current approaches commonly consider WSIs as a bag of cropped patches and process them via multiple instance learning due to the large number of patches, which cannot fully explore the relationship among patches; in other words, the global information cannot be fully incorporated into decision making. Herein, we propose an efficient and effective slide-level classification model, named as FALFormer, that can process a WSI as a whole so as to fully exploit the relationship among the entire patches and to improve the classification performance. FALFormer is built based upon Transformers and self-attention mechanism. To lessen the computational burden of the original self-attention mechanism and to process the entire patches together in a WSI, FALFormer employs Nyström self-attention which approximates the computation by using a smaller number of tokens or landmarks. For effective learning, FALFormer introduces feature-aware landmarks to enhance the representation power of the landmarks and the quality of the approximation. We systematically evaluate the performance of FALFormer using two public datasets, including CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA. The experimental results demonstrate that FALFormer achieves superior performance on both datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for the slide-level classification. This suggests that FALFormer can facilitate an accurate and precise analysis of WSIs, potentially leading to improved diagnosis and prognosis on WSIs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

In the proposed work, we address the problem of whole-slide blood cell segmentation using the semantic segmentation approach. We design a novel convolutional encoder-decoder framework along with VGG-16 as the pixel-level feature extraction model. -e proposed framework comprises 3 main steps: First, all the original images along with manually generated ground truth masks of each blood cell type are passed through the preprocessing stage. In the preprocessing stage, pixel-level labeling, RGB to grayscale conversion of masked image and pixel fusing, and unity mask generation are performed. After that, VGG16 is loaded into the system, which acts as a pretrained pixel-level feature extraction model. In the third step, the training process is initiated on the proposed model. We have evaluated our network performance on three evaluation metrics. We obtained outstanding results with respect to classwise, as well as global and mean accuracies. Our system achieved classwise accuracies of 97.45%, 93.34%, and 85.11% for RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, respectively, while global and mean accuracies remain 97.18% and 91.96%, respectively.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p></details> |  |

In this pilot study, we use histology techniques and whole slide imaging (WSI) to describe the composition and topology of the aerenchyma of an entire leaf blade in an automatic way combining the advantages of X-ray microtomography and optical microscopy. Paraffin blocks are prepared in such a way that microtome slices contain an arbitrarily large number of cross sections distributed along the full length of a blade. The sample organization in the paraffin block coupled with whole slide image analysis allows high throughput data extraction and an exhaustive characterization along the whole blade length. The core of the work are image processing algorithms that can identify cells and air lacunae (or void) from fiber strand, epidermis, mesophyll and vascular system. A set of specific features is developed to adequately describe the convexity of cells and voids where standard descriptors fail. The features scrutinize the local curvature of the object borders to allow an accurate discrimination between void and cell through machine learning. The algorithm allows to reconstruct the cells and cell membrane features that are relevant to tissue density, compressibility and rigidity. Size distribution of the different cell types and gas spaces, total biomass and total void volume fraction are then extracted from the high resolution slices to provide a complete characterization of the tissue along the leave from its base to the apex.</p></details> |  |

The model is trained to classify patches extracted from slides. This leads the training to be made under noisy labeled data. We solve the problem with two complementary strategies. First, the patches are sampled online using the model's knowledge by focusing on regions where the model's confidence is higher. Second, we propose an extension of the KL divergence that is robust to noisy labels. Our preliminary experiment on CAMELYON 16 data set show promising results. The model can successfully segment tumor areas with strong morphological consistency.</p></details> | Performance update |

However, large histology slides with numerous microscopic fields pose challenges for visual search. To aid pathologists, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems offer visual assistance in efficiently examining WSIs and identifying diagnostically relevant regions. This paper presents a novel histopathological image analysis method employing Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) based on Capsule Networks, the first such application. The proposed model is evaluated using the Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP) dataset and its performance is compared with other histopathological semantic segmentation methodologies. The findings underscore the potential of Capsule Networks in enhancing the precision and efficiency of histopathological image analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and the mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) metric.</p></details> |  |

The deep-learning methods used in computational pathology may help us to reduce costs and increase the speed and accuracy of cancer diagnosis. We started with the UNC Melanocytic Tumor Dataset cohort that contains 160 hematoxylin and eosin whole-slide images of primary melanomas (86) and nevi (74). We randomly assigned 80% (134) as a training set and built an in-house deep-learning method to allow for classification, at the slide level, of nevi and melanomas. The proposed method performed well on the other 20% (26) test dataset; the accuracy of the slide classification task was 92.3% and our model also performed well in terms of predicting the region of interest annotated by the pathologists, showing excellent performance of our model on melanocytic skin tumors. Even though we tested the experiments on the skin tumor dataset, our work could also be extended to other medical image detection problems to benefit the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of different tumors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 fig...</summary><p>5 figures, NeurIPS 2022 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Classifying Whole Slide Images: What Matters?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03279v1)** | 2023-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently there have been many algorithms proposed for the classification of very high resolution whole slide images (WSIs). These new algorithms are mostly focused on finding novel ways to combine the information from small local patches extracted from the slide, with an emphasis on effectively aggregating more global information for the final predictor. In this paper we thoroughly explore different key design choices for WSI classification algorithms to investigate what matters most for achieving high accuracy. Surprisingly, we found that capturing global context information does not necessarily mean better performance. A model that captures the most global information consistently performs worse than a model that captures less global information. In addition, a very simple multi-instance learning method that captures no global information performs almost as well as models that capture a lot of global information. These results suggest that the most important features for effective WSI classification are captured at the local small patch level, where cell and tissue micro-environment detail is most pronounced. Another surprising finding was that unsupervised pre-training on a larger set of 33 cancers gives significantly worse performance compared to pre-training on a smaller dataset of 7 cancers (including the target cancer). We posit that pre-training on a smaller, more focused dataset allows the feature extractor to make better use of the limited feature space to better discriminate between subtle differences in the input patch.</p></details> |  |

In order to compare and correlate patterns of different proteins, the images have to be registered with high accuracy. The problem we want to solve is registration of gigapixel whole slide images (WSI). This presents 3 challenges: (i) Images are very large; (ii) Thin sections result in artifacts that make global affine registration prone to very large local errors; (iii) Local affine registration is required to preserve correct tissue morphology (local size, shape and texture). In our approach we compare WSI registration based on automatic and manual feature selection on either the full image or natural sub-regions (as opposed to square tiles). Working with natural sub-regions, in an interactive tool makes it possible to exclude regions containing scientifically irrelevant information. We also present a new way to visualize local registration quality by a Registration Confidence Map (RCM). With this method, intra-tumor heterogeneity and charateristics of the tumor microenvironment can be observed and quantified.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI2018 - Computational Pathology and Ophthalmic Medical Image Analysis - COMPAY</p></details> |

Analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is challenging because they are very large, i.e., of Giga-pixel resolution. Identifying Regions of Interest (ROIs) is the first step for pathologists to analyse further the regions of diagnostic interest for cancer detection and other anomalies. In this paper, we investigate the use of RCNN, which is a deep machine learning technique, for detecting such ROIs only using a small number of labelled WSIs for training. For experimentation, we used real WSIs from a public hospital pathology service in Western Australia. We used 60 WSIs for training the RCNN model and another 12 WSIs for testing. The model was further tested on a new set of unseen WSIs. The results show that RCNN can be effectively used for ROI detection from WSIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the 27th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP 2020) and will be published in the Springer CCIS Series</p></details> |
| **[RLogist: Fast Observation Strategy on Whole-slide Images with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01737v2)** | 2022-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSI) in computational pathology have high resolution with gigapixel size, but are generally with sparse regions of interest, which leads to weak diagnostic relevance and data inefficiency for each area in the slide. Most of the existing methods rely on a multiple instance learning framework that requires densely sampling local patches at high magnification. The limitation is evident in the application stage as the heavy computation for extracting patch-level features is inevitable. In this paper, we develop RLogist, a benchmarking deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for fast observation strategy on WSIs. Imitating the diagnostic logic of human pathologists, our RL agent learns how to find regions of observation value and obtain representative features across multiple resolution levels, without having to analyze each part of the WSI at the high magnification. We benchmark our method on two whole-slide level classification tasks, including detection of metastases in WSIs of lymph node sections, and subtyping of lung cancer. Experimental results demonstrate that RLogist achieves competitive classification performance compared to typical multiple instance learning algorithms, while having a significantly short observation path. In addition, the observation path given by RLogist provides good decision-making interpretability, and its ability of reading path navigation can potentially be used by pathologists for educational/assistive purposes.

However, such pathology measurement is manually made in most clinical practices, subject to severe reader variability due to large sampling bias and poor reproducibility. Although some computerized automated methods are developed to quantify the steatosis regions, they present limited analysis capacity for high resolution whole-slide microscopy images and accurate overlapped steatosis division. In this paper, we propose a method that extracts an individual whole tissue piece at high resolution with minimum background area by estimating tissue bounding box and rotation angle. This is followed by the segmentation and segregation of steatosis regions with high curvature point detection and an ellipse fitting quality assessment method. We validate our method with isolated and overlapped steatosis regions in liver tissue images of 11 patients. The experimental results suggest that our method is promising for enhanced support of steatosis quantization during the pathology review for liver disease treatment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anonymization of Whole Slide Images in Histopathology for Research and Education](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06103v1)** | 2024-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: The exchange of health-related data is subject to regional laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States, resulting in non-trivial challenges for researchers and educators when working with these data. In pathology, the digitization of diagnostic tissue samples inevitably generates identifying data that can consist of sensitive but also acquisition-related information stored in vendor-specific file formats. Distribution and off-clinical use of these Whole Slide Images (WSI) is usually done in these formats, as an industry-wide standardization such as DICOM is yet only tentatively adopted and slide scanner vendors currently do not provide anonymization functionality. Methods: We developed a guideline for the proper handling of histopathological image data particularly for research and education with regard to the GDPR. In this context, we evaluated existing anonymization methods and examined proprietary format specifications to identify all sensitive information for the most common WSI formats. This work results in a software library that enables GDPR-compliant anonymization of WSIs while preserving the native formats. Results: Based on the analysis of proprietary formats, all occurrences of sensitive information were identified for file formats frequently used in clinical routine, and finally, an open-source programming library with an executable CLI-tool and wrappers for different programming languages was developed. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that there is no straightforward software solution to anonymize WSIs in a GDPR-compliant way while maintaining the data format. We closed this gap with our extensible open-source library that works instantaneously and offline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid Whole Slide Imaging via Learning-based Two-shot Virtual Autofocusing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06630v1)** | 2020-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide imaging (WSI) is an emerging technology for digital pathology. The process of autofocusing is the main influence of the performance of WSI. Traditional autofocusing methods either are time-consuming due to repetitive mechanical motions, or require additional hardware and thus are not compatible to current WSI systems. In this paper, we propose the concept of \textit{virtual autofocusing}, which does not rely on mechanical adjustment to conduct refocusing but instead recovers in-focus images in an offline learning-based manner. With the initial focal position, we only perform two-shot imaging, in contrast traditional methods commonly need to conduct as many as 21 times image shooting in each tile scanning. Considering that the two captured out-of-focus images retain pieces of partial information about the underlying in-focus image, we propose a U-Net-inspired deep neural network based approach for fusing them into a recovered in-focus image. The proposed scheme is fast in tissue slides scanning, enabling a high-throughput generation of digital pathology images. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves satisfactory refocusing performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> |

However, achieving such results requires training with numerous manual voxel annotations. This requirement presents a challenge for whole-body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, where lesions are scattered throughout the body. To tackle this problem, we introduce SW-FastEdit - an interactive segmentation framework that accelerates the labeling by utilizing only a few user clicks instead of voxelwise annotations. While prior interactive models crop or resize PET volumes due to memory constraints, we use the complete volume with our sliding window-based interactive scheme. Our model outperforms existing non-sliding window interactive models on the AutoPET dataset and generalizes to the previously unseen HECKTOR dataset. A user study revealed that annotators achieve high-quality predictions with only 10 click iterations and a low perceived NASA-TLX workload. Our framework is implemented using MONAI Label and is available: https://github.com/matt3o/AutoPET2-Submission/</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Diagnostic Text-guided Representation Learning in Hierarchical Classification for Pathological Whole Slide Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10709v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of digital imaging in medical microscopy, artificial intelligent-based analysis of pathological whole slide images (WSIs) provides a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis. Limited by the expensive cost of pixel-level annotation, current research primarily focuses on representation learning with slide-level labels, showing success in various downstream tasks. However, given the diversity of lesion types and the complex relationships between each other, these techniques still deserve further exploration in addressing advanced pathology tasks. To this end, we introduce the concept of hierarchical pathological image classification and propose a representation learning called PathTree. PathTree considers the multi-classification of diseases as a binary tree structure. Each category is represented as a professional pathological text description, which messages information with a tree-like encoder. The interactive text features are then used to guide the aggregation of hierarchical multiple representations. PathTree uses slide-text similarity to obtain probability scores and introduces two extra tree specific losses to further constrain the association between texts and slides. Through extensive experiments on three challenging hierarchical classification datasets: in-house cryosectioned lung tissue lesion identification, public prostate cancer grade assessment, and public breast cancer subtyping, our proposed PathTree is consistently competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new perspective on the deep learning-assisted solution for more complex WSI classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures.

Precise diagnostic criteria for a renal biopsy diagnosis of TMA are missing. As a first step towards a machine learning- and computer vision-based analysis of wholes slide images from renal biopsies, we trained a segmentation model for the decisive diagnostic kidney tissue compartments artery, arteriole, glomerulus on a set of whole slide images from renal biopsies with TMAs and Mimickers (distinct diseases with a similar nephropathological appearance as TMA like severe benign nephrosclerosis, various vasculitides, Bevacizumab-plug glomerulopathy, arteriolar light chain deposition disease). Our segmentation model combines a U-Net-based tissue detection with a Shifted windows-transformer architecture to reach excellent segmentation results for even the most severely altered glomeruli, arterioles and arteries, even on unseen staining domains from a different nephropathology lab. With accurate automatic segmentation of the decisive renal biopsy compartments in human renal vasculopathies, we have laid the foundation for large-scale compartment-specific machine learning and computer vision analysis of renal biopsy repositories with TMAs.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Recent advances in the pathological foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs. However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

In particular, our method adds a training constraint to the supervised contrastive learning approach to achieve domain adaptation and improve inter-class separability. Experiments performed on domain adaptation and classification of whole-slide images of six skin cancer subtypes from two centers demonstrate the method's usefulness.

Tumor region detection, subtype and grade classification are the fundamental diagnostic indicators for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in whole-slide images (WSIs). However, pathological diagnosis is subjective, differences in observation and diagnosis between pathologists is common in hospitals with inadequate diagnostic capacity. The main challenge for developing deep learning based RCC diagnostic system is the lack of large-scale datasets with precise annotations. In this work, we proposed a deep learning-based framework for analyzing histopathological images of patients with renal cell carcinoma, which has the potential to achieve pathologist-level accuracy in diagnosis. A deep convolutional neural network (InceptionV3) was trained on the high-quality annotated dataset of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) whole-slide histopathological image for accurate tumor area detection, classification of RCC subtypes, and ISUP grades classification of clear cell carcinoma subtypes. These results suggest that our framework can help pathologists in the detection of cancer region and classification of subtypes and grades, which could be applied to any cancer type, providing auxiliary diagnosis and promoting clinical consensus.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2021 accepted, 9 pages including reference, 3 figures and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Tissue Cross-Section and Pen Marking Segmentation in Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13511v1)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue segmentation is a routine preprocessing step to reduce the computational cost of whole slide image (WSI) analysis by excluding background regions. Traditional image processing techniques are commonly used for tissue segmentation, but often require manual adjustments to parameter values for atypical cases, fail to exclude all slide and scanning artifacts from the background, and are unable to segment adipose tissue. Pen marking artifacts in particular can be a potential source of bias for subsequent analyses if not removed. In addition, several applications require the separation of individual cross-sections, which can be challenging due to tissue fragmentation and adjacent positioning. To address these problems, we develop a convolutional neural network for tissue and pen marking segmentation using a dataset of 200 H&E stained WSIs. For separating tissue cross-sections, we propose a novel post-processing method based on clustering predicted centroid locations of the cross-sections in a 2D histogram. On an independent test set, the model achieved a mean Dice score of 0.981$\pm$0.033 for tissue segmentation and a mean Dice score of 0.912$\pm$0.090 for pen marking segmentation. The mean absolute difference between the number of annotated and separated cross-sections was 0.075$\pm$0.350. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately segment H&E stained tissue cross-sections and pen markings in WSIs while being robust to many common slide and scanning artifacts. The model with trained model parameters and post-processing method are made publicly available as a Python package called SlideSegmenter.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

However, the direct application of conventional image processing algorithms to WSI faces certain obstacles because of WSIs' distinct property: the super-high resolution. The performance of most WSI-related tasks relies on the efficacy of the backbone which extracts WSI patch feature representations. Hence, we proposed BROW, a foundation model for extracting better feature representations for WSIs, which can be conveniently adapted to downstream tasks without or with slight fine-tuning. The model takes transformer architecture, pretrained using self-distillation framework. To improve model's robustness, techniques such as patch shuffling have been employed. Additionally, the model leverages the unique properties of WSIs, utilizing WSI's multi-scale pyramid to incorporate an additional global view, thereby further enhancing its performance. We used both private and public data to make up a large pretraining dataset, containing more than 11000 slides, over 180M extracted patches, encompassing WSIs related to various organs and tissues. To assess the effectiveness of \ourmodel, we run a wide range of downstream tasks, including slide-level subtyping, patch-level classification and nuclei instance segmentation. The results confirmed the efficacy, robustness and good generalization ability of the proposed model. This substantiates its potential as foundation model for WSI feature extraction and highlights promising prospects for its application in WSI processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages including reference part, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging image captions for selective whole slide image annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06363v1)** | 2024-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring annotations for whole slide images (WSIs)-based deep learning tasks, such as creating tissue segmentation masks or detecting mitotic figures, is a laborious process due to the extensive image size and the significant manual work involved in the annotation. This paper focuses on identifying and annotating specific image regions that optimize model training, given a limited annotation budget. While random sampling helps capture data variance by collecting annotation regions throughout the WSIs, insufficient data curation may result in an inadequate representation of minority classes. Recent studies proposed diversity sampling to select a set of regions that maximally represent unique characteristics of the WSIs. This is done by pretraining on unlabeled data through self-supervised learning and then clustering all regions in the latent space. However, establishing the optimal number of clusters can be difficult and not all clusters are task-relevant. This paper presents prototype sampling, a new method for annotation region selection. It discovers regions exhibiting typical characteristics of each task-specific class. The process entails recognizing class prototypes from extensive histopathology image-caption databases and detecting unlabeled image regions that resemble these prototypes. Our results show that prototype sampling is more effective than random and diversity sampling in identifying annotation regions with valuable training information, resulting in improved model performance in semantic segmentation and mitotic figure detection tasks.

| **[CNN Cascades for Segmenting Whole Slide Images of the Kidney](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.00251v1)** | 2020-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the increasing availability of whole slide scanners facilitating digitization of histopathological tissue, there is a strong demand for the development of computer based image analysis systems. In this work, the focus is on the segmentation of the glomeruli constituting a highly relevant structure in renal histopathology, which has not been investigated before in combination with CNNs. We propose two different CNN cascades for segmentation applications with sparse objects. These approaches are applied to the problem of glomerulus segmentation and compared with conventional fully-convolutional networks. Overall, with the best performing cascade approach, single CNNs are outperformed and a pixel-level Dice similarity coefficient of 0.90 is obtained. Combined with qualitative and further object-level analyses the obtained results are assessed as excellent also compared to recent approaches. In conclusion, we can state that especially one of the proposed cascade networks proved to be a highly powerful tool for segmenting the renal glomeruli providing best segmentation accuracies and also keeping the computing time at a low level.</p></details> |  |

Current research into improving compression algorithms is focused on methods allowing lower compression rates for Regions of Interest (ROI-based approaches). Neural networks are great at extracting meaningful semantic representations from images, therefore are able to select the regions to be considered of interest for the compression process. In this work, we focus on the compression of whole slide histopathology images. The objective is to build an ensemble of neural networks that enables a compressive autoencoder in a supervised fashion to retain a denser and more meaningful representation of the input histology images. Our proposed system is a simple and novel method to supervise compressive neural networks. We test the compressed images using transfer learning-based classifiers and show that they provide promising accuracy and classification performance.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing MIL methods primarily focus on improving the feature extractor and aggregator. However, one deficiency of these methods is that the bag contextual prior may trick the model into capturing spurious correlations between bags and labels. This deficiency is a confounder that limits the performance of existing MIL methods. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning (IBMIL), to achieve deconfounded bag-level prediction. Unlike traditional likelihood-based strategies, the proposed scheme is based on the backdoor adjustment to achieve the interventional training, thus is capable of suppressing the bias caused by the bag contextual prior. Note that the principle of IBMIL is orthogonal to existing bag MIL methods. Therefore, IBMIL is able to bring consistent performance boosting to existing schemes, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

To study tumour microenvironment (TME) with the context of various protein biomarkers and cell sub-types, analysis and registration of features using multi-stained WSIs is often required. Multi-stained WSI pairs normally suffer from rigid and non-rigid deformities in addition to slide artefacts and control tissue which present challenges at precise registration. Traditional registration methods mainly focus on global rigid/non-rigid registration but struggle with aligning slides with complex tissue deformations at the nuclei level. However, nuclei level non-rigid registration is essential for downstream tasks such as cell sub-type analysis in the context of protein biomarker signatures. This paper focuses on local level non-rigid registration using a nuclei-location based point set registration approach for aligning multi-stained WSIs. We exploit the spatial distribution of nuclei that is prominent and consistent (to a large level) across different stains to establish a spatial correspondence. We evaluate our approach using the HYRECO dataset consisting of 54 re-stained images of H\&E and PHH3 image pairs. The approach can be extended to other IHC and IF stained WSIs considering a good nuclei detection algorithm is accessible. The performance of the model is tested against established registration algorithms and is shown to outperform the model for nuclei level registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to Medical Image Understanding and Analysis Conference 2024</p></details> |
| **[Lifelong Whole Slide Image Analysis: Online Vision-Language Adaptation and Past-to-Present Gradient Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01984v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> | IEEE Access (2025) |
| **[Finding Regions of Interest in Whole Slide Images Using Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01446v2)** | 2024-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSI), obtained by high-resolution digital scanning of microscope slides at multiple scales, are the cornerstone of modern Digital Pathology. However, they represent a particular challenge to AI-based/AI-mediated analysis because pathology labeling is typically done at slide-level, instead of tile-level. It is not just that medical diagnostics is recorded at the specimen level, the detection of oncogene mutation is also experimentally obtained, and recorded by initiatives like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), at the slide level. This configures a dual challenge: a) accurately predicting the overall cancer phenotype and b) finding out what cellular morphologies are associated with it at the tile level. To address these challenges, a weakly supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach was explored for two prevalent cancer types, Invasive Breast Carcinoma (TCGA-BRCA) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-LUSC). This approach was explored for tumor detection at low magnification levels and TP53 mutations at various levels. Our results show that a novel additive implementation of MIL matched the performance of reference implementation (AUC 0.96), and was only slightly outperformed by Attention MIL (AUC 0.97). More interestingly from the perspective of the molecular pathologist, these different AI architectures identify distinct sensitivities to morphological features (through the detection of Regions of Interest, RoI) at different amplification levels. Tellingly, TP53 mutation was most sensitive to features at the higher applications where cellular morphology is resolved.</p></details> |  |

Naturally a question comes to us that whether the combination of pixel-level (e.g., segmentation) and image level (e.g., classification) annotation can introduce further improvement. However in computational pathology this is a difficult task for this reason: High resolution of whole slide images makes it difficult to do end-to-end classification model training, which is challenging to research of weak or hybrid supervision learning in the past. To handle this problem, we propose a hybrid supervision learning framework for this kind of high resolution images with sufficient image-level coarse annotations and a few pixel-level fine labels. This framework, when applied in training patch model, can carefully make use of coarse image-level labels to refine generated pixel-level pseudo labels. Complete strategy is proposed to suppress pixel-level false positives and false negatives. A large hybrid annotated dataset is used to evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid supervision learning. By extracting pixel-level pseudo labels in initially image-level labeled samples, we achieve 5.2% higher specificity than purely training on existing labels while retaining 100% sensitivity, in the task of image-level classification to be positive or negative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in MICCAI2021</p></details> |

Especially in the field of mitosis detection, it is assumed that detection accuracy could significantly benefit from larger annotation databases that are currently however very troublesome to produce. Further, multiple independent (blind) expert labels are a big asset for such databases, yet there is currently no tool for this kind of annotation available. To ease this tedious process of expert annotation and grading, we introduce SlideRunner, an open source annotation and visualization tool for digital histopathology, developed in close cooperation with two pathologists.

Current approaches for nucleus detection in gigapixel WSIs utilize a sliding window methodology, which overlooks boarder contextual information (eg, tissue structure) and easily leads to inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, recent studies additionally crops a large Filed-of-View (FoV) region around each sliding window to extract contextual features. However, such methods substantially increases the inference latency. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient context-aware nucleus detection algorithm. Specifically, instead of leveraging large FoV regions, we aggregate contextual clues from off-the-shelf features of historically visited sliding windows. This design greatly reduces computational overhead. Moreover, compared to large FoV regions at a low magnification, the sliding window patches have higher magnification and provide finer-grained tissue details, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy. To further improve the efficiency, we propose a grid pooling technique to compress dense feature maps of each patch into a few contextual tokens. Finally, we craft OCELOT-seg, the first benchmark dedicated to context-aware nucleus instance segmentation. Code, dataset, and model checkpoints will be available at https://github.com/windygoo/PathContext.</p></details> | under review |

The system's use of deep-learning-based confidence scoring as a criterion to consider the result as accurate yields an accuracy of up to 98\%, and makes it adoptable in a real-world setting. Without confidence scoring, the system achieved an accuracy of 78\%. We anticipate that our deep learning system will serve as a foundation enabling faster diagnosis of skin cancer, identification of cases for specialist review, and targeted diagnostic classifications.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

For instance, when deploying an image analysis algorithm on whole-slide images (WSI), the computational bottleneck often lies in the input-output (I/O) system. This is particularly notable as patch-level processing introduces a considerable I/O load onto the computer system. However, this data management process could be further paralleled, given the typical independence of patch-level image processes across different patches. This paper details our endeavors in tackling this data access challenge by implementing the Adaptable IO System version 2 (ADIOS2). Our focus has been constructing and releasing a digital pathology-centric pipeline using ADIOS2, which facilitates streamlined data management across WSIs. Additionally, we've developed strategies aimed at curtailing data retrieval times. The performance evaluation encompasses two key scenarios: (1) a pure CPU-based image analysis scenario ("CPU scenario"), and (2) a GPU-based deep learning framework scenario ("GPU scenario"). Our findings reveal noteworthy outcomes. Under the CPU scenario, ADIOS2 showcases an impressive two-fold speed-up compared to the brute-force approach. In the GPU scenario, its performance stands on par with the cutting-edge GPU I/O acceleration framework, NVIDIA Magnum IO GPU Direct Storage (GDS).

| **[Pathology-knowledge Enhanced Multi-instance Prompt Learning for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10814v1)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-instance learning algorithms for pathology image analysis often require a substantial number of Whole Slide Images for effective training but exhibit suboptimal performance in scenarios with limited learning data. In clinical settings, restricted access to pathology slides is inevitable due to patient privacy concerns and the prevalence of rare or emerging diseases. The emergence of the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification accommodates the significant challenge of the limited slide data and sparse slide-level labels for diagnosis. Prompt learning based on the pre-trained models (\eg, CLIP) appears to be a promising scheme for this setting; however, current research in this area is limited, and existing algorithms often focus solely on patch-level prompts or confine themselves to language prompts. This paper proposes a multi-instance prompt learning framework enhanced with pathology knowledge, \ie, integrating visual and textual prior knowledge into prompts at both patch and slide levels. The training process employs a combination of static and learnable prompts, effectively guiding the activation of pre-trained models and further facilitating the diagnosis of key pathology patterns. Lightweight Messenger (self-attention) and Summary (attention-pooling) layers are introduced to model relationships between patches and slides within the same patient data. Additionally, alignment-wise contrastive losses ensure the feature-level alignment between visual and textual learnable prompts for both patches and slides. Our method demonstrates superior performance in three challenging clinical tasks, significantly outperforming comparative few-shot methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024</p></details> |

| **[Leveraging Unlabeled Whole-Slide-Images for Mitosis Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11677v1)** | 2018-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mitosis count is an important biomarker for prognosis of various cancers. At present, pathologists typically perform manual counting on a few selected regions of interest in breast whole-slide-images (WSIs) of patient biopsies. This task is very time-consuming, tedious and subjective. Automated mitosis detection methods have made great advances in recent years. However, these methods require exhaustive labeling of a large number of selected regions of interest. This task is very expensive because expert pathologists are needed for reliable and accurate annotations. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised mitosis detection method which is designed to leverage a large number of unlabeled breast cancer WSIs. As a result, our method capitalizes on the growing number of digitized histology images, without relying on exhaustive annotations, subsequently improving mitosis detection. Our method first learns a mitosis detector from labeled data, uses this detector to mine additional mitosis samples from unlabeled WSIs, and then trains the final model using this larger and diverse set of mitosis samples. The use of unlabeled data improves F1-score by $\sim$5\% compared to our best performing fully-supervised model on the TUPAC validation set. Our submission (single model) to TUPAC challenge ranks highly on the leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.64.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI COMPAY 2018 Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Thyroid Cancer Malignancy Prediction From Whole Slide Cytopathology Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00839v1)** | 2020-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider preoperative prediction of thyroid cancer based on ultra-high-resolution whole-slide cytopathology images. Inspired by how human experts perform diagnosis, our approach first identifies and classifies diagnostic image regions containing informative thyroid cells, which only comprise a tiny fraction of the entire image. These local estimates are then aggregated into a single prediction of thyroid malignancy. Several unique characteristics of thyroid cytopathology guide our deep-learning-based approach. While our method is closely related to multiple-instance learning, it deviates from these methods by using a supervised procedure to extract diagnostically relevant regions. Moreover, we propose to simultaneously predict thyroid malignancy, as well as a diagnostic score assigned by a human expert, which further allows us to devise an improved training strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to human experts, and demonstrate the potential of using the algorithm for screening and as an assistive tool for the improved diagnosis of indeterminate cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple and Efficient Confidence Score for Grading Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04604v1)** | 2023-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grading precancerous lesions on whole slide images is a challenging task: the continuous space of morphological phenotypes makes clear-cut decisions between different grades often difficult, leading to low inter- and intra-rater agreements. More and more Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to help pathologists perform and standardize their diagnosis. However, those models can render their prediction without consideration of the ambiguity of the classes and can fail without notice which prevent their wider acceptance in a clinical context. In this paper, we propose a new score to measure the confidence of AI models in grading tasks. Our confidence score is specifically adapted to ordinal output variables, is versatile and does not require extra training or additional inferences nor particular architecture changes. Comparison to other popular techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout and deep ensembles shows that our method provides state-of-the art results, while being simpler, more versatile and less computationally intensive. The score is also easily interpretable and consistent with real life hesitations of pathologists. We show that the score is capable of accurately identifying mispredicted slides and that accuracy for high confidence decisions is significantly higher than for low-confidence decisions (gap in AUC of 17.1% on the test set). We believe that the proposed confidence score could be leveraged by pathologists directly in their workflow and assist them on difficult tasks such as grading precancerous lesions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Self-Supervised Learning of Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04763v1)** | 2023-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Presenting whole slide images (WSIs) as graph will enable a more efficient and accurate learning framework for cancer diagnosis. Due to the fact that a single WSI consists of billions of pixels and there is a lack of vast annotated datasets required for computational pathology, the problem of learning from WSIs using typical deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural network (CNN) is challenging. Additionally, WSIs down-sampling may lead to the loss of data that is essential for cancer detection. A novel two-stage learning technique is presented in this work. Since context, such as topological features in the tumor surroundings, may hold important information for cancer grading and diagnosis, a graph representation capturing all dependencies among regions in the WSI is very intuitive. Graph convolutional network (GCN) is deployed to include context from the tumor and adjacent tissues, and self-supervised learning is used to enhance training through unlabeled data. More specifically, the entire slide is presented as a graph, where the nodes correspond to the patches from the WSI. The proposed framework is then tested using WSIs from prostate and kidney cancers. To assess the performance improvement through self-supervised mechanism, the proposed context-aware model is tested with and without use of pre-trained self-supervised layer. The overall model is also compared with multi-instance learning (MIL) based and other existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideGraph+: Whole Slide Image Level Graphs to Predict HER2Status in Breast Cancer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06042v1)** | 2021-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important prognostic and predictive factor which is overexpressed in 15-20% of breast cancer (BCa). The determination of its status is a key clinical decision making step for selection of treatment regimen and prognostication. HER2 status is evaluated using transcroptomics or immunohistochemistry (IHC) through situ hybridisation (ISH) which require additional costs and tissue burden in addition to analytical variabilities in terms of manual observational biases in scoring. In this study, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) based model (termed SlideGraph+) to predict HER2 status directly from whole-slide images of routine Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) slides. The network was trained and tested on slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in addition to two independent test datasets. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values > 0.75 on TCGA and 0.8 on independent test sets. Our experiments show that the proposed approach can be utilised for case triaging as well as pre-ordering diagnostic tests in a diagnostic setting. It can also be used for other weakly supervised prediction problems in computational pathology.

| **[Differentiable Zooming for Multiple Instance Learning on Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12454v4)** | 2022-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have become increasingly popular for classifying giga-pixel sized Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) in digital pathology. Most MIL methods operate at a single WSI magnification, by processing all the tissue patches. Such a formulation induces high computational requirements, and constrains the contextualization of the WSI-level representation to a single scale. A few MIL methods extend to multiple scales, but are computationally more demanding. In this paper, inspired by the pathological diagnostic process, we propose ZoomMIL, a method that learns to perform multi-level zooming in an end-to-end manner. ZoomMIL builds WSI representations by aggregating tissue-context information from multiple magnifications. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods in WSI classification on two large datasets, while significantly reducing the computational demands with regard to Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) and processing time by up to 40x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Typos...</summary><p>Typos corrected; Changed dataset name from INSEC to CRC upon dataset creators' request; Update affiliation and fix typos;</p></details> |

In most MIL based analytical pipelines for WSI-level analysis, the WSIs are often divided into patches and deep features for patches (i.e., patch embeddings) are extracted prior to training to reduce the overall computational cost and cope with the GPUs' limited RAM. To overcome this limitation, we present EmbAugmenter, a data augmentation generative adversarial network (DA-GAN) that can synthesize data augmentations in the embedding space rather than in the pixel space, thereby significantly reducing the computational requirements. Experiments on the SICAPv2 dataset show that our approach outperforms MIL without augmentation and is on par with traditional patch-level augmentation for MIL training while being substantially faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, ISBI 2023</p></details> |

There has been a surge of research in deep learning models for WSI classification with clinical applications such as cancer detection or prediction of molecular mutations from WSIs. Most methods require expensive and labor-intensive manual annotations by expert pathologists. Weakly supervised Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have recently demonstrated excellent performance; however, they still require large slide-level labeled training datasets that need a careful inspection of each slide by an expert pathologist. In this work, we propose a fully unsupervised WSI classification algorithm based on mutual transformer learning. Instances from gigapixel WSI (i.e., image patches) are transformed into a latent space and then inverse-transformed to the original space. Using the transformation loss, pseudo-labels are generated and cleaned using a transformer label-cleaner. The proposed transformer-based pseudo-label generation and cleaning modules mutually train each other iteratively in an unsupervised manner. A discriminative learning mechanism is introduced to improve normal versus cancerous instance labeling. In addition to unsupervised classification, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for weak supervision for cancer subtype classification as downstream analysis. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show excellent performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We intend to make the source code of our algorithm publicly available soon.</p></details> |  |

We proposed the ACDC@LungHP (Automatic Cancer Detection and Classification in Whole-slide Lung Histopathology) challenge for evaluating different computer-aided diagnosis (CADs) methods on the automatic diagnosis of lung cancer. The ACDC@LungHP 2019 focused on segmentation (pixel-wise detection) of cancer tissue in whole slide imaging (WSI), using an annotated dataset of 150 training images and 50 test images from 200 patients. This paper reviews this challenge and summarizes the top 10 submitted methods for lung cancer segmentation. All methods were evaluated using the false positive rate, false negative rate, and DICE coefficient (DC). The DC ranged from 0.7354$\pm$0.1149 to 0.8372$\pm$0.0858. The DC of the best method was close to the inter-observer agreement (0.8398$\pm$0.0890). All methods were based on deep learning and categorized into two groups: multi-model method and single model method. In general, multi-model methods were significantly better ($\textit{p}$<$0.01$) than single model methods, with mean DC of 0.7966 and 0.7544, respectively. Deep learning based methods could potentially help pathologists find suspicious regions for further analysis of lung cancer in WSI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based generation of Histopathological Whole Slide Images at a Gigapixel scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08199v1)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel diffusion-based approach to generate synthetic histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) at an unprecedented gigapixel scale. Synthetic WSIs have many potential applications: They can augment training datasets to enhance the performance of many computational pathology applications. They allow the creation of synthesized copies of datasets that can be shared without violating privacy regulations. Or they can facilitate learning representations of WSIs without requiring data annotations. Despite this variety of applications, no existing deep-learning-based method generates WSIs at their typically high resolutions. Mainly due to the high computational complexity. Therefore, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine sampling scheme to tackle image generation of high-resolution WSIs. In this scheme, we increase the resolution of an initial low-resolution image to a high-resolution WSI. Particularly, a diffusion model sequentially adds fine details to images and increases their resolution. In our experiments, we train our method with WSIs from the TCGA-BRCA dataset. Additionally to quantitative evaluations, we also performed a user study with pathologists. The study results suggest that our generated WSIs resemble the structure of real WSIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tumor segmentation on whole slide images: training or prompting?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13932v1)** | 2024-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tumor segmentation stands as a pivotal task in cancer diagnosis. Given the immense dimensions of whole slide images (WSI) in histology, deep learning approaches for WSI classification mainly operate at patch-wise or superpixel-wise level. However, these solutions often struggle to capture global WSI information and cannot directly generate the binary mask. Downsampling the WSI and performing semantic segmentation is another possible approach. While this method offers computational efficiency, it necessitates a large amount of annotated data since resolution reduction may lead to information loss. Visual prompting is a novel paradigm that allows the model to perform new tasks by making subtle modifications to the input space, rather than adapting the model itself. Such approach has demonstrated promising results on many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we show the efficacy of visual prompting in the context of tumor segmentation for three distinct organs. In comparison to classical methods trained for this specific task, our findings reveal that, with appropriate prompt examples, visual prompting can achieve comparable or better performance without extensive fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, ISBI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Transformer for Survival Prediction Using Multimodality Whole Slide Images and Genomics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.16632v1)** | 2022-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning good representation of giga-pixel level whole slide pathology images (WSI) for downstream tasks is critical. Previous studies employ multiple instance learning (MIL) to represent WSIs as bags of sampled patches because, for most occasions, only slide-level labels are available, and only a tiny region of the WSI is disease-positive area. However, WSI representation learning still remains an open problem due to: (1) patch sampling on a higher resolution may be incapable of depicting microenvironment information such as the relative position between the tumor cells and surrounding tissues, while patches at lower resolution lose the fine-grained detail; (2) extracting patches from giant WSI results in large bag size, which tremendously increases the computational cost. To solve the problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical-based multimodal transformer framework that learns a hierarchical mapping between pathology images and corresponding genes. Precisely, we randomly extract instant-level patch features from WSIs with different magnification. Then a co-attention mapping between imaging and genomics is learned to uncover the pairwise interaction and reduce the space complexity of imaging features. Such early fusion makes it computationally feasible to use MIL Transformer for the survival prediction task. Our architecture requires fewer GPU resources compared with benchmark methods while maintaining better WSI representation ability. We evaluate our approach on five cancer types from the Cancer Genome Atlas database and achieved an average c-index of $0.673$, outperforming the state-of-the-art multimodality methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICPR 2022</p></details> |

In computational pathology, where Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of digitally scanned tissue samples from patients can be multi-gigapixels in size, determination of degree of similarity between two WSIs is a challenging task with a number of practical applications. In this work, we explore a novel strategy based on kernelized Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) analysis for determination of pairwise similarity between WSIs. The proposed approach works by calculating MMD between two WSIs using kernels over deep features of image patches. This allows representation of an entire dataset of WSIs as a kernel matrix for WSI level clustering, weakly-supervised prediction of TP-53 mutation status in breast cancer patients from their routine WSIs as well as survival analysis with state of the art prediction performance. We believe that this work will open up further avenues for application of WSI-level kernels for predictive and prognostic tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>* Joi...</summary><p>* Joint first authorship Accepted: IEEE - ISBI 2023 International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging</p></details> |

Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions.

In this paper, we propose a kernel attention Transformer (KAT) for histopathology WSI classification. The information transmission of the tokens is achieved by cross-attention between the tokens and a set of kernels related to a set of positional anchors on the WSI. Compared to the common Transformer structure, the proposed KAT can better describe the hierarchical context information of the local regions of the WSI and meanwhile maintains a lower computational complexity. The proposed method was evaluated on a gastric dataset with 2040 WSIs and an endometrial dataset with 2560 WSIs, and was compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results have demonstrated the proposed KAT is effective and efficient in the task of histopathology WSI classification and is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

To address these issues, we propose MExD, an Expert-Infused Diffusion Model that combines the strengths of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism with a diffusion model for enhanced classification. MExD balances patch feature distribution through a novel MoE-based aggregator that selectively emphasizes relevant information, effectively filtering noise, addressing data imbalance, and extracting essential features. These features are then integrated via a diffusion-based generative process to directly yield the class distribution for the WSI. Moving beyond conventional discriminative approaches, MExD represents the first generative strategy in WSI classification, capturing fine-grained details for robust and precise results. Our MExD is validated on three widely-used benchmarks-Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and BRACS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance in both binary and multi-class tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |

We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p></details> |  |

Each patch of a mosaic is encoded to a feature vector using a deep network. The feature extractor model is fine-tuned using hierarchical target labels of WSIs, i.e., anatomic site and primary diagnosis. In the second stage, a set of encoded patch-level features from a WSI is used to compute the primary diagnosis probability through the proposed Pay Attention with Focus scheme, an attention-weighted averaging of predicted probabilities for all patches of a mosaic modulated by a trainable focal factor.

Image retrieval can provide pathologists with unprecedented access to the evidence embodied in already diagnosed and treated cases from the past. This paper proposes a search engine specialized for digital pathology, called Yottixel, a portmanteau for "one yotta pixel," alluding to the big-data nature of histopathology images. The most impressive characteristic of Yottixel is its ability to represent whole slide images (WSIs) in a compact manner. Yottixel can perform millions of searches in real-time with a high search accuracy and low storage profile. Yottixel uses an intelligent indexing algorithm capable of representing WSIs with a mosaic of patches by converting them into a small number of methodically extracted barcodes, called "Bunch of Barcodes" (BoB), the most prominent performance enabler of Yottixel. The performance of the prototype platform is qualitatively tested using 300 WSIs from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and 2,020 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) provided by the National Cancer Institute. Both datasets amount to more than 4,000,000 patches of 1000x1000 pixels. We report three sets of experiments that show that Yottixel can accurately retrieve organs and malignancies, and its semantic ordering shows good agreement with the subjective evaluation of human observers.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically rely on pre-trained models from large natural image datasets, such as ImageNet, to generate instance features, which can be sub-optimal due to the significant differences between natural images and histopathology images that lead to a domain shift. In this paper, we present a novel, simple yet effective method for learning domain-specific knowledge transformation from pre-trained models to histopathology images. Our approach entails using a prompt component to assist the pre-trained model in discerning differences between the pre-trained dataset and the target histopathology dataset, resulting in improved performance of MIL models. We validate our method on two publicly available datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our method for different MIL models and backbones.

In this study, we investigated whether deep learning algorithms can predict patients' risk of recurrence by analyzing the pathology images of their cancer histology.We analyzed 125 hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from 125 patients across two institutions (National Cancer Center and Korea University Medical Center Guro Hospital) to predict breast cancer recurrence risk using deep learning. Sensitivity reached 0.857, 0.746, and 0.529 for low, intermediate, and high-risk categories, respectively, with specificity of 0.816, 0.803, and 0.972, and a Pearson correlation of 0.61 with histological grade. Class activation maps highlighted features like tubule formation and mitotic rate, suggesting a cost-effective approach to risk stratification, pending broader validation. These findings suggest that deep learning models trained exclusively on hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images can approximate genomic assay results, offering a cost-effective and scalable tool for breast cancer recurrence risk assessment. However, further validation using larger and more balanced datasets is needed to confirm the clinical applicability of our approach.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[SEW: Self-calibration Enhanced Whole Slide Pathology Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10853v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology images are considered the ``gold standard" for cancer diagnosis and treatment, with gigapixel images providing extensive tissue and cellular information. Existing methods fail to simultaneously extract global structural and local detail features for comprehensive pathology image analysis efficiently. To address these limitations, we propose a self-calibration enhanced framework for whole slide pathology image analysis, comprising three components: a global branch, a focus predictor, and a detailed branch. The global branch initially classifies using the pathological thumbnail, while the focus predictor identifies relevant regions for classification based on the last layer features of the global branch. The detailed extraction branch then assesses whether the magnified regions correspond to the lesion area. Finally, a feature consistency constraint between the global and detail branches ensures that the global branch focuses on the appropriate region and extracts sufficient discriminative features for final identification. These focused discriminative features prove invaluable for uncovering novel prognostic tumor markers from the perspective of feature cluster uniqueness and tissue spatial distribution. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed framework can rapidly deliver accurate and explainable results for pathological grading and prognosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

Different to the current image-based survival models that limit to key patches or clusters derived from Whole Slide Images (WSIs), we propose Deep Attention Multiple Instance Survival Learning (DeepAttnMISL) by introducing both siamese MI-FCN and attention-based MIL pooling to efficiently learn imaging features from the WSI and then aggregate WSI-level information to patient-level. Attention-based aggregation is more flexible and adaptive than aggregation techniques in recent survival models. We evaluated our methods on two large cancer whole slide images datasets and our results suggest that the proposed approach is more effective and suitable for large datasets and has better interpretability in locating important patterns and features that contribute to accurate cancer survival predictions. The proposed framework can also be used to assess individual patient's risk and thus assisting in delivering personalized medicine.

| **[Classification of Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma Whole-Slide Pathology Images Using Deep Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10957v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ovarian cancer is the most lethal cancer of the female reproductive organs. There are $5$ major histological subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, each with distinct morphological, genetic, and clinical features. Currently, these histotypes are determined by a pathologist's microscopic examination of tumor whole-slide images (WSI). This process has been hampered by poor inter-observer agreement (Cohen's kappa $0.54$-$0.67$). We utilized a \textit{two}-stage deep transfer learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and progressive resizing for automatic classification of epithelial ovarian carcinoma WSIs. The proposed algorithm achieved a mean accuracy of $87.54\%$ and Cohen's kappa of $0.8106$ in the slide-level classification of $305$ WSIs; performing better than a standard CNN and pathologists without gynecology-specific training.</p></details> |  |

Tools to assist in making a diagnosis are required to manage the increasing workload. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep-learning based tools may be used in daily pathology practice. However, it is challenging to develop fast and reliable algorithms that can be trusted by practitioners, whatever the medical center. We describe a patch-based algorithm that incorporates a convolutional neural network to detect and locate invasive carcinoma on breast whole-slide images. The network was trained on a dataset extracted from a reference acquisition center. We then performed a calibration step based on transfer learning to maintain the performance when translating on a new target acquisition center by using a limited amount of additional training data. Performance was evaluated using classical binary measures (accuracy, recall, precision) for both centers (referred to as test reference dataset and test target dataset) and at two levels: patch and slide level. At patch level, accuracy, recall, and precision of the model on the reference and target test sets were 92.1\% and 96.3\%, 95\% and 87.8\%, and 73.9\% and 70.6\%, respectively. At slide level, accuracy, recall, and precision were 97.6\% and 92.0\%, 90.9\% and 100\%, and 100\% and 70.8\% for test sets 1 and 2, respectively. The high performance of the algorithm at both centers shows that the calibration process is efficient. This is performed using limited training data from the new target acquisition center and requires that the model is trained beforehand on a large database from a reference center. This methodology allows the implementation of AI diagnostic tools to help in routine pathology practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specific Pre-training Improves Confidence in Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09833v2)** | 2024-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) or histopathology images are used in digital pathology. WSIs pose great challenges to deep learning models for clinical diagnosis, owing to their size and lack of pixel-level annotations. With the recent advancements in computational pathology, newer multiple-instance learning-based models have been proposed. Multiple-instance learning for WSIs necessitates creating patches and uses the encoding of these patches for diagnosis. These models use generic pre-trained models (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) for patch encoding. The recently proposed KimiaNet, a DenseNet121 model pre-trained on TCGA slides, is a domain-specific pre-trained model. This paper shows the effect of domain-specific pre-training on WSI classification. To investigate the effect of domain-specific pre-training, we considered the current state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning models, 1) CLAM, an attention-based model, and 2) TransMIL, a self-attention-based model, and evaluated the models' confidence and predictive performance in detecting primary brain tumors - gliomas. Domain-specific pre-training improves the confidence of the models and also achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of WSI-based glioma subtype classification, showing a high clinical applicability in assisting glioma diagnosis. We will publicly share our code and experimental results at https://github.com/soham-chitnis10/WSI-domain-specific.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EMBC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MHAttnSurv: Multi-Head Attention for Survival Prediction Using Whole-Slide Pathology Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11558v1)** | 2021-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pathology, whole-slide images (WSI) based survival prediction has attracted increasing interest. However, given the large size of WSIs and the lack of pathologist annotations, extracting the prognostic information from WSIs remains a challenging task. Previous studies have used multiple instance learning approaches to combine the information from multiple randomly sampled patches, but different visual patterns may contribute differently to prognosis prediction. In this study, we developed a multi-head attention approach to focus on various parts of a tumor slide, for more comprehensive information extraction from WSIs. We evaluated our approach on four cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Our model achieved an average c-index of 0.640, outperforming two existing state-of-the-art approaches for WSI-based survival prediction, which have an average c-index of 0.603 and 0.619 on these datasets. Visualization of our attention maps reveals each attention head focuses synergistically on different morphological patterns.</p></details> |  |

First, the lack of hand-annotated datasets to train algorithms. Second, the lack of interactive paradigms to enable a dialogue between the pathologist and the machine, which can be a major obstacle for use in clinical routine. We therefore propose a fast and user oriented method to bridge this gap by giving the pathologist control over the final result while limiting the number of interactions needed to achieve a good result (over 90\% on all our metrics with only 4 correction scribbles).</p></details> |  |
| **[Compact and De-biased Negative Instance Embedding for Multi-Instance Learning on Whole-Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10595v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) classification is a challenging task because 1) patches from WSI lack annotation, and 2) WSI possesses unnecessary variability, e.g., stain protocol. Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/pathology_mil.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024</p></details> |
| **[A graph-transformer for whole slide image classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09671v1)** | 2022-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is a powerful tool for whole slide image (WSI) analysis. Typically, when performing supervised deep learning, a WSI is divided into small patches, trained and the outcomes are aggregated to estimate disease grade. However, patch-based methods introduce label noise during training by assuming that each patch is independent with the same label as the WSI and neglect overall WSI-level information that is significant in disease grading. Here we present a Graph-Transformer (GT) that fuses a graph-based representation of an WSI and a vision transformer for processing pathology images, called GTP, to predict disease grade. We selected $4,818$ WSIs from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and used GTP to distinguish adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) from adjacent non-cancerous tissue (normal). First, using NLST data, we developed a contrastive learning framework to generate a feature extractor. This allowed us to compute feature vectors of individual WSI patches, which were used to represent the nodes of the graph followed by construction of the GTP framework. Our model trained on the CPTAC data achieved consistently high performance on three-label classification (normal versus LUAD versus LSCC: mean accuracy$= 91.2$ $\pm$ $2.5\%$) based on five-fold cross-validation, and mean accuracy $= 82.3$ $\pm$ $1.0\%$ on external test data (TCGA). We also introduced a graph-based saliency mapping technique, called GraphCAM, that can identify regions that are highly associated with the class label. Our findings demonstrate GTP as an interpretable and effective deep learning framework for WSI-level classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[A deep learning based multiscale approach to segment cancer area in liver whole slide image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12935v1)** | 2020-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of liver cancer segmentation in Whole Slide Image (WSI). We propose a multi-scale image processing method based on automatic end-to-end deep neural network algorithm for segmentation of cancer area. A seven-levels gaussian pyramid representation of the histopathological image was built to provide the texture information in different scales. In this work, several neural architectures were compared using the original image level for the training procedure. The proposed method is based on U-Net applied to seven levels of various resolutions (pyramidal subsumpling). The predictions in different levels are combined through a voting mechanism. The final segmentation result is generated at the original image level. Partial color normalization and weighted overlapping method were applied in preprocessing and prediction separately. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed multi-scales approach achieving better scores compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Image Classification through Fisher Vector Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08530v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of digital pathology, particularly through computational analysis of whole slide images (WSI), is poised to significantly enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency. However, the large size and complexity of WSIs make it difficult to analyze and classify them using computers. This study introduces a novel method for WSI classification by automating the identification and examination of the most informative patches, thus eliminating the need to process the entire slide. Our method involves two-stages: firstly, it extracts only a few patches from the WSIs based on their pathological significance; and secondly, it employs Fisher vectors (FVs) for representing features extracted from these patches, which is known for its robustness in capturing fine-grained details. This approach not only accentuates key pathological features within the WSI representation but also significantly reduces computational overhead, thus making the process more efficient and scalable. We have rigorously evaluated the proposed method across multiple datasets to benchmark its performance against comprehensive WSI analysis and contemporary weakly-supervised learning methodologies. The empirical results indicate that our focused analysis of select patches, combined with Fisher vector representation, not only aligns with, but at times surpasses, the classification accuracy of standard practices. Moreover, this strategy notably diminishes computational load and resource expenditure, thereby establishing an efficient and precise framework for WSI analysis in the realm of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepSDCS: Dissecting cancer proliferation heterogeneity in Ki67 digital whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10850v1)** | 2018-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ki67 is an important biomarker for breast cancer. Classification of positive and negative Ki67 cells in histology slides is a common approach to determine cancer proliferation status. However, there is a lack of generalizable and accurate methods to automate Ki67 scoring in large-scale patient cohorts. In this work, we have employed a novel deep learning technique based on hypercolumn descriptors for cell classification in Ki67 images. Specifically, we developed the Simultaneous Detection and Cell Segmentation (DeepSDCS) network to perform cell segmentation and detection. VGG16 network was used for the training and fine tuning to training data. We extracted the hypercolumn descriptors of each cell to form the vector of activation from specific layers to capture features at different granularity. Features from these layers that correspond to the same pixel were propagated using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer to yield the detection of the nuclei and the final cell segmentations. Subsequently, seeds generated from cell segmentation were propagated to a spatially constrained convolutional neural network for the classification of the cells into stromal, lymphocyte, Ki67-positive cancer cell, and Ki67-negative cancer cell. We validated its accuracy in the context of a large-scale clinical trial of oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. We achieved 99.06% and 89.59% accuracy on two separate test sets of Ki67 stained breast cancer dataset comprising biopsy and whole-slide images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Scale Prototypical Transformer for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.02308v1)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) classification is an essential task in computational pathology. Despite the recent advances in multiple instance learning (MIL) for WSI classification, accurate classification of WSIs remains challenging due to the extreme imbalance between the positive and negative instances in bags, and the complicated pre-processing to fuse multi-scale information of WSI. To this end, we propose a novel multi-scale prototypical Transformer (MSPT) for WSI classification, which includes a prototypical Transformer (PT) module and a multi-scale feature fusion module (MFFM). The PT is developed to reduce redundant instances in bags by integrating prototypical learning into the Transformer architecture. It substitutes all instances with cluster prototypes, which are then re-calibrated through the self-attention mechanism of the Trans-former. Thereafter, an MFFM is proposed to fuse the clustered prototypes of different scales, which employs MLP-Mixer to enhance the information communication between prototypes. The experimental results on two public WSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSPT outperforms all the compared algorithms, suggesting its potential applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantics-Aware Attention Guidance for Diagnosing Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10894v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in digital pathology, largely due to the gigapixel size and complex spatial relationships present in whole slide images. Traditional multiple instance learning (MIL) methods often struggle with these intricacies, especially in preserving the necessary context for accurate diagnosis. In response, we introduce a novel framework named Semantics-Aware Attention Guidance (SAG), which includes 1) a technique for converting diagnostically relevant entities into attention signals, and 2) a flexible attention loss that efficiently integrates various semantically significant information, such as tissue anatomy and cancerous regions. Our experiments on two distinct cancer datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy, precision, and recall with two state-of-the-art baseline models. Qualitative analysis further reveals that the incorporation of heuristic guidance enables the model to focus on regions critical for diagnosis. SAG is not only effective for the models discussed here, but its adaptability extends to any attention-based diagnostic model. This opens up exciting possibilities for further improving the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the size and high-resolution nature of these images, they are generally only accessed in smaller sections or tiles via specialized platforms, most of which require extensive setup and/or costly infrastructure. These platforms typically also need a copy of the images to be locally available to them, potentially causing issues with data governance and provenance. To address these concerns, we developed ImageBox3, an in-browser tiling mechanism to enable zero-footprint traversal of remote WSI data. All computation is performed client-side without compromising user governance, operating public and private images alike as long as the storage service supports HTTP range requests (standard in Cloud storage and most web servers). ImageBox3 thus removes significant hurdles to WSI operation and effective collaboration, allowing for the sort of democratized analytical tools needed to establish participative, FAIR digital pathology data commons.

However, WSIs present unique computational and algorithmic challenges. WSIs are gigapixel-sized ($\sim$100K pixels), making them infeasible to be used directly for training deep neural networks. Also, often only slide-level labels are available for training as detailed annotations are tedious and can be time-consuming for experts. Approaches using multiple-instance learning (MIL) frameworks have been shown to overcome these challenges. Current state-of-the-art approaches divide the learning framework into two decoupled parts: a convolutional neural network (CNN) for encoding the patches followed by an independent aggregation approach for slide-level prediction. In this approach, the aggregation step has no bearing on the representations learned by the CNN encoder. We have proposed an end-to-end framework that clusters the patches from a WSI into ${k}$-groups, samples ${k}'$ patches from each group for training, and uses an adaptive attention mechanism for slide level prediction; Cluster-to-Conquer (C2C). We have demonstrated that dividing a WSI into clusters can improve the model training by exposing it to diverse discriminative features extracted from the patches. We regularized the clustering mechanism by introducing a KL-divergence loss between the attention weights of patches in a cluster and the uniform distribution. The framework is optimized end-to-end on slide-level cross-entropy, patch-level cross-entropy, and KL-divergence loss (Implementation: https://github.com/YashSharma/C2C).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MIDL, 2021 - https://openreview.net/forum?id=7i1-2oKIELU</p></details> |
| **[Multi-domain stain normalization for digital pathology: A cycle-consistent adversarial network for whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09431v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The variation in histologic staining between different medical centers is one of the most profound challenges in the field of computer-aided diagnosis. The appearance disparity of pathological whole slide images causes algorithms to become less reliable, which in turn impedes the wide-spread applicability of downstream tasks like cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, different stainings lead to biases in the training which in case of domain shifts negatively affect the test performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose MultiStain-CycleGAN, a multi-domain approach to stain normalization based on CycleGAN. Our modifications to CycleGAN allow us to normalize images of different origins without retraining or using different models. We perform an extensive evaluation of our method using various metrics and compare it to commonly used methods that are multi-domain capable. First, we evaluate how well our method fools a domain classifier that tries to assign a medical center to an image. Then, we test our normalization on the tumor classification performance of a downstream classifier. Furthermore, we evaluate the image quality of the normalized images using the Structural similarity index and the ability to reduce the domain shift using the Fréchet inception distance. We show that our method proves to be multi-domain capable, provides the highest image quality among the compared methods, and can most reliably fool the domain classifier while keeping the tumor classifier performance high. By reducing the domain influence, biases in the data can be removed on the one hand and the origin of the whole slide image can be disguised on the other, thus enhancing patient data privacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Specifically, we utilize `partial' label proportions, which give the proportions among tumor subtypes but do not give the proportion between tumor and non-tumor. Partial label proportions are recorded as the standard diagnostic information by pathologists, and we, therefore, want to use them for realizing the segmentation model that can classify each WSI patch into one of the tumor subtypes or non-tumor. We call this problem ``learning from partial label proportions (LPLP)'' and formulate the problem as a weakly supervised learning problem. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm for this challenging problem by decomposing it into two weakly supervised learning subproblems: multiple instance learning (MIL) and learning from label proportions (LLP). These subproblems are optimized efficiently in the end-to-end manner. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated through experiments conducted on two WSI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI2024</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Transformer for Long Contextual Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14195v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis serves as the gold standard for clinical cancer diagnosis in the daily routines of doctors. To develop computer-aided diagnosis model for WSIs, previous methods typically employ Multi-Instance Learning to enable slide-level prediction given only slide-level labels. Among these models, vanilla attention mechanisms without pairwise interactions have traditionally been employed but are unable to model contextual information. More recently, self-attention models have been utilized to address this issue. To alleviate the computational complexity of long sequences in large WSIs, methods like HIPT use region-slicing, and TransMIL employs approximation of full self-attention. Both approaches suffer from suboptimal performance due to the loss of key information. Moreover, their use of absolute positional embedding struggles to effectively handle long contextual dependencies in shape-varying WSIs. In this paper, we first analyze how the low-rank nature of the long-sequence attention matrix constrains the representation ability of WSI modelling. Then, we demonstrate that the rank of attention matrix can be improved by focusing on local interactions via a local attention mask. Our analysis shows that the local mask aligns with the attention patterns in the lower layers of the Transformer. Furthermore, the local attention mask can be implemented during chunked attention calculation, reducing the quadratic computational complexity to linear with a small local bandwidth. Building on this, we propose a local-global hybrid Transformer for both computational acceleration and local-global information interactions modelling. Our method, Long-contextual MIL (LongMIL), is evaluated through extensive experiments on various WSI tasks to validate its superiority. Our code will be available at github.com/invoker-LL/Long-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS-2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.12885</p></details> |

However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Current methods typically rely on manual region labeling or multi-stage learning to assemble local representations (e.g., patch-level) into global features (e.g., slide-level). However, there is no effective way to integrate multi-scale image representations with text data in a seamless end-to-end process. In this study, we introduce Multi-Level Text-Guided Representation End-to-End Learning (mTREE). This novel text-guided approach effectively captures multi-scale WSI representations by utilizing information from accompanying textual pathology information. mTREE innovatively combines - the localization of key areas (global-to-local) and the development of a WSI-level image-text representation (local-to-global) - into a unified, end-to-end learning framework. In this model, textual information serves a dual purpose: firstly, functioning as an attention map to accurately identify key areas, and secondly, acting as a conduit for integrating textual features into the comprehensive representation of the image. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of mTREE through quantitative analyses in two image-related tasks: classification and survival prediction, showcasing its remarkable superiority over baselines.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MIL methods do not explicitly model the data distribution, and instead they only learn a bag-level or instance-level decision boundary discriminatively by training a classifier. In this paper, we propose DGMIL: a feature distribution guided deep MIL framework for WSI classification and positive patch localization. Instead of designing complex discriminative network architectures, we reveal that the inherent feature distribution of histopathological image data can serve as a very effective guide for instance classification. We propose a cluster-conditioned feature distribution modeling method and a pseudo label-based iterative feature space refinement strategy so that in the final feature space the positive and negative instances can be easily separated. Experiments on the CAMELYON16 dataset and the TCGA Lung Cancer dataset show that our method achieves new SOTA for both global classification and positive patch localization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by MICCAI 2022</p></details> |
| **[Learning to be EXACT, Cell Detection for Asthma on Partially Annotated Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04943v1)** | 2021-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the lower respiratory tract and naturally occurs in humans and animals including horses. The annotation of an asthma microscopy whole slide image (WSI) is an extremely labour-intensive task due to the hundreds of thousands of cells per WSI. To overcome the limitation of annotating WSI incompletely, we developed a training pipeline which can train a deep learning-based object detection model with partially annotated WSIs and compensate class imbalances on the fly. With this approach we can freely sample from annotated WSIs areas and are not restricted to fully annotated extracted sub-images of the WSI as with classical approaches. We evaluated our pipeline in a cross-validation setup with a fixed training set using a dataset of six equine WSIs of which four are partially annotated and used for training, and two fully annotated WSI are used for validation and testing. Our WSI-based training approach outperformed classical sub-image-based training methods by up to 15\% $mAP$ and yielded human-like performance when compared to the annotations of ten trained pathologists.</p></details> | Submitted to BVM |
| **[FAST: A Dual-tier Few-Shot Learning Paradigm for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19720v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expensive fine-grained annotation and data scarcity have become the primary obstacles for the widespread adoption of deep learning-based Whole Slide Images (WSI) classification algorithms in clinical practice. Unlike few-shot learning methods in natural images that can leverage the labels of each image, existing few-shot WSI classification methods only utilize a small number of fine-grained labels or weakly supervised slide labels for training in order to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation. They lack sufficient mining of available WSIs, severely limiting WSI classification performance. To address the above issues, we propose a novel and efficient dual-tier few-shot learning paradigm for WSI classification, named FAST. FAST consists of a dual-level annotation strategy and a dual-branch classification framework. Firstly, to avoid expensive fine-grained annotation, we collect a very small number of WSIs at the slide level, and annotate an extremely small number of patches. Then, to fully mining the available WSIs, we use all the patches and available patch labels to build a cache branch, which utilizes the labeled patches to learn the labels of unlabeled patches and through knowledge retrieval for patch classification. In addition to the cache branch, we also construct a prior branch that includes learnable prompt vectors, using the text encoder of visual-language models for patch classification. Finally, we integrate the results from both branches to achieve WSI classification. Extensive experiments on binary and multi-class datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly surpasses existing few-shot classification methods and approaches the accuracy of fully supervised methods with only 0.22$\%$ annotation costs. All codes and models will be publicly available on https://github.com/fukexue/FAST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Integrative Graph-Transformer Framework for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Representation and Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18134v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In digital pathology, the multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy is widely used in the weakly supervised histopathology whole slide image (WSI) classification task where giga-pixel WSIs are only labeled at the slide level. However, existing attention-based MIL approaches often overlook contextual information and intrinsic spatial relationships between neighboring tissue tiles, while graph-based MIL frameworks have limited power to recognize the long-range dependencies. In this paper, we introduce the integrative graph-transformer framework that simultaneously captures the context-aware relational features and global WSI representations through a novel Graph Transformer Integration (GTI) block. Specifically, each GTI block consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer modeling neighboring relations at the local instance level and an efficient global attention model capturing comprehensive global information from extensive feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and BRIGHT, demonstrate the superiority of our approach over current state-of-the-art MIL methods, achieving an improvement of 1.0% to 2.6% in accuracy and 0.7%-1.6% in AUROC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patch-based Convolutional Neural Network for Whole Slide Tissue Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07947v5)** | 2016-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are state-of-the-art models for many image classification tasks. However, to recognize cancer subtypes automatically, training a CNN on gigapixel resolution Whole Slide Tissue Images (WSI) is currently computationally impossible. The differentiation of cancer subtypes is based on cellular-level visual features observed on image patch scale. Therefore, we argue that in this situation, training a patch-level classifier on image patches will perform better than or similar to an image-level classifier. The challenge becomes how to intelligently combine patch-level classification results and model the fact that not all patches will be discriminative. We propose to train a decision fusion model to aggregate patch-level predictions given by patch-level CNNs, which to the best of our knowledge has not been shown before. Furthermore, we formulate a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) based method that automatically locates discriminative patches robustly by utilizing the spatial relationships of patches. We apply our method to the classification of glioma and non-small-cell lung carcinoma cases into subtypes. The classification accuracy of our method is similar to the inter-observer agreement between pathologists. Although it is impossible to train CNNs on WSIs, we experimentally demonstrate using a comparable non-cancer dataset of smaller images that a patch-based CNN can outperform an image-based CNN.</p></details> |  |

This hierarchical structure is believed to be beneficial for cancer diagnosis and prognosis tasks. However, most previous hierarchical WSI analysis works (1) only characterize local or global correlations within the WSI pyramids and (2) use only unidirectional interaction between different resolutions, leading to an incomplete picture of WSI pyramids. To this end, this paper presents a novel Hierarchical Interaction Graph-Transformer (i.e., HIGT) for WSI analysis. With Graph Neural Network and Transformer as the building commons, HIGT can learn both short-range local information and long-range global representation of the WSI pyramids. Considering that the information from different resolutions is complementary and can benefit each other during the learning process, we further design a novel Bidirectional Interaction block to establish communication between different levels within the WSI pyramids. Finally, we aggregate both coarse-grained and fine-grained features learned from different levels together for slide-level prediction. We evaluate our methods on two public WSI datasets from TCGA projects, i.e., kidney carcinoma (KICA) and esophageal carcinoma (ESCA). Experimental results show that our HIGT outperforms both hierarchical and non-hierarchical state-of-the-art methods on both tumor subtyping and staging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2023; Code is available in https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/HIGT</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Based Quality Control of Histopathology Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03289v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We developed a software pipeline for quality control (QC) of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) that segments various regions, such as blurs of different levels, tissue regions, tissue folds, and pen marks. Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

In this paper, we propose a whole slide image (WSI) based genetic biomarker prediction method via prompting techniques. Our work aims at addressing the following challenges: (1) extracting foreground instances related to genetic biomarkers from gigapixel WSIs, and (2) the interaction among the fine-grained pathological components in WSIs.Specifically, we leverage large language models to generate medical prompts that serve as prior knowledge in extracting instances associated with genetic biomarkers. We adopt a coarse-to-fine approach to mine biomarker information within the tumor microenvironment. This involves extracting instances related to genetic biomarkers using coarse medical prior knowledge, grouping pathology instances into fine-grained pathological components and mining their interactions. Experimental results on two colorectal cancer datasets show the superiority of our method, achieving 91.49% in AUC for MSI classification. The analysis further shows the clinical interpretability of our method.

| **[What a Whole Slide Image Can Tell? Subtype-guided Masked Transformer for Pathological Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20607v1)** | 2023-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological captioning of Whole Slide Images (WSIs), though is essential in computer-aided pathological diagnosis, has rarely been studied due to the limitations in datasets and model training efficacy. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm Subtype-guided Masked Transformer (SGMT) for pathological captioning based on Transformers, which treats a WSI as a sequence of sparse patches and generates an overall caption sentence from the sequence. An accompanying subtype prediction is introduced into SGMT to guide the training process and enhance the captioning accuracy. We also present an Asymmetric Masked Mechansim approach to tackle the large size constraint of pathological image captioning, where the numbers of sequencing patches in SGMT are sampled differently in the training and inferring phases, respectively. Experiments on the PatchGastricADC22 dataset demonstrate that our approach effectively adapts to the task with a transformer-based model and achieves superior performance than traditional RNN-based methods. Our codes are to be made available for further research and development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Semi-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification by Two-level Cross Consistency Supervision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12132v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical pathological diagnosis. It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.</p></details> |  |

In computational pathology, domain-specific VLMs, which are pre-trained on extensive histopathology image-text datasets, have succeeded in various downstream tasks. However, existing research has primarily focused on the pre-training process and direct applications of VLMs on the patch level, leaving their great potential for whole slide image (WSI) applications unexplored. In this study, we hypothesize that pre-trained VLMs inherently capture informative and interpretable WSI representations through quantitative feature extraction. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce Vision and Language Embeddings for Explainable WSI Representation (VLEER), a novel method designed to leverage VLMs for WSI representation. We systematically evaluate VLEER on three pathological WSI datasets, proving its better performance in WSI analysis compared to conventional vision features. More importantly, VLEER offers the unique advantage of interpretability, enabling direct human-readable insights into the results by leveraging the textual modality for detailed pathology annotations, providing clear reasoning for WSI-level pathology downstream tasks.</p></details> | Under review |

Existing approaches typically rely on frozen pre-trained models to extract instance features, neglecting the substantial domain shift between pre-training natural and histopathological images. To address this issue, we propose PAMT, a novel Prompt-guided Adaptive Model Transformation framework that enhances MIL classification performance by seamlessly adapting pre-trained models to the specific characteristics of histopathology data. To capture the intricate histopathology distribution, we introduce Representative Patch Sampling (RPS) and Prototypical Visual Prompt (PVP) to reform the input data, building a compact while informative representation. Furthermore, to narrow the domain gap, we introduce Adaptive Model Transformation (AMT) that integrates adapter blocks within the feature extraction pipeline, enabling the pre-trained models to learn domain-specific features. We rigorously evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC, showcasing substantial improvements across various MIL models. Our findings affirm the potential of PAMT to set a new benchmark in WSI classification, underscoring the value of a targeted reprogramming approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[LESS: Label-efficient Multi-scale Learning for Cytological Whole Slide Image Screening](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03407v2)** | 2023-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, multiple instance learning (MIL) is widely used to circumvent the computational impasse in giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI) analysis. It usually consists of two stages: patch-level feature extraction and slide-level aggregation. Recently, pretrained models or self-supervised learning have been used to extract patch features, but they suffer from low effectiveness or inefficiency due to overlooking the task-specific supervision provided by slide labels. Here we propose a weakly-supervised Label-Efficient WSI Screening method, dubbed LESS, for cytological WSI analysis with only slide-level labels, which can be effectively applied to small datasets. First, we suggest using variational positive-unlabeled (VPU) learning to uncover hidden labels of both benign and malignant patches. We provide appropriate supervision by using slide-level labels to improve the learning of patch-level features. Next, we take into account the sparse and random arrangement of cells in cytological WSIs. To address this, we propose a strategy to crop patches at multiple scales and utilize a cross-attention vision transformer (CrossViT) to combine information from different scales for WSI classification. The combination of our two steps achieves task-alignment, improving effectiveness and efficiency. We validate the proposed label-efficient method on a urine cytology WSI dataset encompassing 130 samples (13,000 patches) and FNAC 2019 dataset with 212 samples (21,200 patches). The experiment shows that the proposed LESS reaches 84.79%, 85.43%, 91.79% and 78.30% on a urine cytology WSI dataset, and 96.88%, 96.86%, 98.95%, 97.06% on FNAC 2019 dataset in terms of accuracy, AUC, sensitivity and specificity. It outperforms state-of-the-art MIL methods on pathology WSIs and realizes automatic cytological WSI cancer screening.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to Medical Image Analysis.

Although the existing multi-scale vision Transformer has shown its effectiveness for learning multi-scale image representation, it still cannot work well on the gigapixel WSIs due to their extremely large image sizes. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-scale Efficient Graph-Transformer (MEGT) framework for WSI classification. The key idea of MEGT is to adopt two independent Efficient Graph-based Transformer (EGT) branches to process the low-resolution and high-resolution patch embeddings (i.e., tokens in a Transformer) of WSIs, respectively, and then fuse these tokens via a multi-scale feature fusion module (MFFM). Specifically, we design an EGT to efficiently learn the local-global information of patch tokens, which integrates the graph representation into Transformer to capture spatial-related information of WSIs. Meanwhile, we propose a novel MFFM to alleviate the semantic gap among different resolution patches during feature fusion, which creates a non-patch token for each branch as an agent to exchange information with another branch by cross-attention. In addition, to expedite network training, a novel token pruning module is developed in EGT to reduce the redundant tokens. Extensive experiments on TCGA-RCC and CAMELYON16 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MEGT.</p></details> |  |
| **[UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20653v3)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</p></details> | preprint |

The current paradigm is mainly based on multiple instance learning (MIL), in which approaches with Transformer as the backbone are well discussed. These methods convert WSI tasks into sequence tasks by representing patches as tokens in the WSI sequence. However, the feature complexity brought by high heterogeneity and the ultra-long sequences brought by gigapixel size makes Transformer-based MIL suffer from the challenges of high memory consumption, slow inference speed, and lack of performance. To this end, we propose a retentive MIL method called RetMIL, which processes WSI sequences through hierarchical feature propagation structure. At the local level, the WSI sequence is divided into multiple subsequences. Tokens of each subsequence are updated through a parallel linear retention mechanism and aggregated utilizing an attention layer. At the global level, subsequences are fused into a global sequence, then updated through a serial retention mechanism, and finally the slide-level representation is obtained through a global attention pooling. We conduct experiments on two public CAMELYON and BRACS datasets and an public-internal LUNG dataset, confirming that RetMIL not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also significantly reduces computational overhead. Our code will be accessed shortly.</p></details> | under review |

However, generating automatic tools for processing WSIs is challenging due to their enormous sizes. Currently, to deal with this issue, conventional methods rely on a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy to process a WSI at patch level. Although effective, such methods are computationally expensive, because tiling a WSI into patches takes time and does not explore the spatial relations between these tiles. To tackle these limitations, we propose a locally supervised learning framework which processes the entire slide by exploring the entire local and global information that it contains. This framework divides a pre-trained network into several modules and optimizes each module locally using an auxiliary model. We also introduce a random feature reconstruction unit (RFR) to preserve distinguishing features during training and improve the performance of our method by 1% to 3%. Extensive experiments on three publicly available WSI datasets: TCGA-NSCLC, TCGA-RCC and LKS, highlight the superiority of our method on different classification tasks. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods by 2% to 5% in accuracy, while being 7 to 10 times faster. Additionally, when dividing it into eight modules, our method requires as little as 20% of the total gpu memory required by end-to-end training.

Manual quantification of immune cells is inaccurate and time consuming for pathologists. Our aim is to leverage a computational solution to automatically quantify TILs in whole slide images (WSIs) of standard diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin stained sections (H&E slides) from lung cancer patients. Our approach is to transfer an open source machine learning method for segmentation and classification of nuclei in H&E slides trained on public data to TIL quantification without manual labeling of our data. Our results show that additional augmentation improves model transferability when training on few samples/limited tissue types. Models trained with sufficient samples/tissue types do not benefit from our additional augmentation policy. Further, the resulting TIL quantification correlates to patient prognosis and compares favorably to the current state-of-the-art method for immune cell detection in non-small lung cancer (current standard CD8 cells in DAB stained TMAs HR 0.34 95% CI 0.17-0.68 vs TILs in HE WSIs: HoVer-Net PanNuke Aug Model HR 0.30 95% CI 0.15-0.60, HoVer-Net MoNuSAC Aug model HR 0.27 95% CI 0.14-0.53). Moreover, we implemented a cloud based system to train, deploy and visually inspect machine learning based annotation for H&E slides. Our pragmatic approach bridges the gap between machine learning research, translational clinical research and clinical implementation. However, validation in prospective studies is needed to assert that the method works in a clinical setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 11 supplementary pages</p></details> |
| **[SOS: Selective Objective Switch for Rapid Immunofluorescence Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05080v1)** | 2020-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) in clinical microscopy has been a long-standing barrier to implementing computer aided diagnostic systems. Since modern computing resources are unable to perform computations at this extremely large scale, current state of the art methods utilize patch-based processing to preserve the resolution of WSIs. However, these methods are often resource intensive and make significant compromises on processing time. In this paper, we demonstrate that conventional patch-based processing is redundant for certain WSI classification tasks where high resolution is only required in a minority of cases. This reflects what is observed in clinical practice; where a pathologist may screen slides using a low power objective and only switch to a high power in cases where they are uncertain about their findings. To eliminate these redundancies, we propose a method for the selective use of high resolution processing based on the confidence of predictions on downscaled WSIs --- we call this the Selective Objective Switch (SOS). Our method is validated on a novel dataset of 684 Liver-Kidney-Stomach immunofluorescence WSIs routinely used in the investigation of autoimmune liver disease. By limiting high resolution processing to cases which cannot be classified confidently at low resolution, we maintain the accuracy of patch-level analysis whilst reducing the inference time by a factor of 7.74.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at CVPR2020</p></details> |
| **[From Traditional to Deep Learning Approaches in Whole Slide Image Registration: A Methodological Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19123v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) registration is an essential task for analysing the tumour microenvironment (TME) in histopathology. It involves the alignment of spatial information between WSIs of the same section or serial sections of a tissue sample. The tissue sections are usually stained with single or multiple biomarkers before imaging, and the goal is to identify neighbouring nuclei along the Z-axis for creating a 3D image or identifying subclasses of cells in the TME. This task is considerably more challenging compared to radiology image registration, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, due to various factors. These include gigapixel size of images, variations in appearance between differently stained tissues, changes in structure and morphology between non-consecutive sections, and the presence of artefacts, tears, and deformations. Currently, there is a noticeable gap in the literature regarding a review of the current approaches and their limitations, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the available approaches and their application for various purposes. Furthermore, we investigate current deep learning methods used for WSI registration, emphasising their diverse methodologies. We examine the available datasets and explore tools and software employed in the field. Finally, we identify open challenges and potential future trends in this area of research.</p></details> |  |

A critical challenge of WSI is to perform accurate focusing in high speed. Traditional systems create a focus map prior to scanning. For each focus point on the map, sample needs to be static in the x-y plane and axial scanning is needed to maximize the contrast. Here we report a novel focus map surveying method for WSI. The reported method requires no axial scanning, no additional camera and lens, works for stained and transparent samples, and allows continuous sample motion in the surveying process. It can be used for both brightfield and fluorescence WSI. By using a 20X, 0.75 NA objective lens, we demonstrate a mean focusing error of ~0.08 microns in the static mode and ~0.17 microns in the continuous motion mode. The reported method may provide a turnkey solution for most existing WSI systems for its simplicity, robustness, accuracy, and high-speed. It may also standardize the imaging performance of WSI systems for digital pathology and find other applications in high-content microscopy such as DNA sequencing and time-lapse live-cell imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning-based Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03081v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11846v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |

Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTFD-MIL: Double-Tier Feature Distillation Multiple Instance Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12081v1)** | 2022-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been increasingly used in the classification of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). However, MIL approaches for this specific classification problem still face unique challenges, particularly those related to small sample cohorts. In these, there are limited number of WSI slides (bags), while the resolution of a single WSI is huge, which leads to a large number of patches (instances) cropped from this slide. To address this issue, we propose to virtually enlarge the number of bags by introducing the concept of pseudo-bags, on which a double-tier MIL framework is built to effectively use the intrinsic features. Besides, we also contribute to deriving the instance probability under the framework of attention-based MIL, and utilize the derivation to help construct and analyze the proposed framework. The proposed method outperforms other latest methods on the CAMELYON-16 by substantially large margins, and is also better in performance on the TCGA lung cancer dataset. The proposed framework is ready to be extended for wider MIL applications. The code is available at: https://github.com/hrzhang1123/DTFD-MIL</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2022 |
| **[Efficient and generalizable prediction of molecular alterations in multiple cancer cohorts using H&E whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15816v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular testing of tumor samples for targetable biomarkers is restricted by a lack of standardization, turnaround-time, cost, and tissue availability across cancer types. Additionally, targetable alterations of low prevalence may not be tested in routine workflows. Algorithms that predict DNA alterations from routinely generated hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images could prioritize samples for confirmatory molecular testing. Costs and the necessity of a large number of samples containing mutations limit approaches that train individual algorithms for each alteration. In this work, models were trained for simultaneous prediction of multiple DNA alterations from H&E images using a multi-task approach. Compared to biomarker-specific models, this approach performed better on average, with pronounced gains for rare mutations. The models reasonably generalized to independent temporal-holdout, externally-stained, and multi-site TCGA test sets. Additionally, whole slide image embeddings derived using multi-task models demonstrated strong performance in downstream tasks that were not a part of training. Overall, this is a promising approach to develop clinically useful algorithms that provide multiple actionable predictions from a single slide.</p></details> |  |

Traditional cell segmentation approaches, while commonly used, are computationally expensive and require extensive post-processing, limiting their practicality for high-throughput clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from segmentation to detection for extracting cell information from WSIs, introducing CellNuc-DETR as a more effective solution. We evaluate the accuracy performance of CellNuc-DETR on the PanNuke dataset and conduct cross-dataset evaluations on CoNSeP and MoNuSeg to assess robustness and generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both cell nuclei detection and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of CellNuc-DETR on large WSIs, showing that it not only outperforms current methods in accuracy but also significantly reduces inference times. Specifically, CellNuc-DETR is twice as fast as the fastest segmentation-based method, HoVer-NeXt, while achieving substantially higher accuracy. Moreover, it surpasses CellViT in accuracy and is approximately ten times more efficient in inference speed on WSIs. These results establish CellNuc-DETR as a superior approach for cell analysis in digital pathology, combining high accuracy with computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[An Accelerated Pipeline for Multi-label Renal Pathology Image Segmentation at the Whole Slide Image Level](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14566v1)** | 2023-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep-learning techniques have been used widely to alleviate the labour-intensive and time-consuming manual annotation required for pixel-level tissue characterization. Our previous study introduced an efficient single dynamic network - Omni-Seg - that achieved multi-class multi-scale pathological segmentation with less computational complexity. However, the patch-wise segmentation paradigm still applies to Omni-Seg, and the pipeline is time-consuming when providing segmentation for Whole Slide Images (WSIs). In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of the Omni-Seg pipeline in order to reduce the repetitive computing processes and utilize a GPU to accelerate the model's prediction for both better model performance and faster speed. Our proposed method's innovative contribution is two-fold: (1) a Docker is released for an end-to-end slide-wise multi-tissue segmentation for WSIs; and (2) the pipeline is deployed on a GPU to accelerate the prediction, achieving better segmentation quality in less time. The proposed accelerated implementation reduced the average processing time (at the testing stage) on a standard needle biopsy WSI from 2.3 hours to 22 minutes, using 35 WSIs from the Kidney Tissue Atlas (KPMP) Datasets. The source code and the Docker have been made publicly available at https://github.com/ddrrnn123/Omni-Seg.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoFormer for Position Aware Multiple Instance Learning in Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01924v1)** | 2023-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a critical task in computational pathology. However, the gigapixel-size of such images remains a major challenge for the current state of deep-learning. Current methods rely on multiple-instance learning (MIL) models with frozen feature extractors. Given the the high number of instances in each image, MIL methods have long assumed independence and permutation-invariance of patches, disregarding the tissue structure and correlation between patches. Recent works started studying this correlation between instances but the computational workload of such a high number of tokens remained a limiting factor. In particular, relative position of patches remains unaddressed. We propose to apply a straightforward encoding module, namely a RoFormer layer , relying on memory-efficient exact self-attention and relative positional encoding. This module can perform full self-attention with relative position encoding on patches of large and arbitrary shaped WSIs, solving the need for correlation between instances and spatial modeling of tissues. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MIL models on three commonly used public datasets (TCGA-NSCLC, BRACS and Camelyon16)) on weakly supervised classification tasks.

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report in detail how pathologists navigate WSIs of prostate cancer as they accumulate information for their diagnoses. We collected slide navigation data (i.e., viewport location, magnification level, and time) from 13 pathologists in 2 groups (5 genitourinary (GU) specialists and 8 general pathologists) and generated visual attention heatmaps and scanpaths. Each pathologist examined five WSIs from the TCGA PRAD dataset, which were selected by a GU pathology specialist. We examined and analyzed the distributions of visual attention for each group of pathologists after each WSI was examined. To quantify the relationship between a pathologist's attention and evidence for cancer in the WSI, we obtained tumor annotations from a genitourinary specialist. We used these annotations to compute the overlap between the distribution of visual attention and annotated tumor region to identify strong correlations. Motivated by this analysis, we trained a deep learning model to predict visual attention on unseen WSIs. We find that the attention heatmaps predicted by our model correlate quite well with the ground truth attention heatmap and tumor annotations on a test set of 17 WSIs by using various spatial and temporal evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>ISBI ...</summary><p>ISBI 2022 (Oral presentation)</p></details> |

In addition to this, the proposed framework has been extensively evaluated on a large-scale PCa dataset containing 10,516 whole slide scans (with around 71.7M patches), where it outperforms state-of-the-art schemes by 3.22% (in terms of mean intersection-over-union) for extracting the Gleason tissues and 6.91% (in terms of F1 score) for grading the progression of PCa.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE SAS-2021, Source Code is available at https://github.com/taimurhassan/cancer</p></details> |
| **[Handcrafted Histological Transformer (H2T): Unsupervised Representation of Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07001v2)** | 2022-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic decision-making of cancer in pathology clinics can now be carried out based on analysis of multi-gigapixel tissue images, also known as whole-slide images (WSIs). Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to derive unsupervised WSI representations; these are attractive as they rely less on expert annotation which is cumbersome. However, a major trade-off is that higher predictive power generally comes at the cost of interpretability, posing a challenge to their clinical use where transparency in decision-making is generally expected. To address this challenge, we present a handcrafted framework based on deep CNN for constructing holistic WSI-level representations. Building on recent findings about the internal working of the Transformer in the domain of natural language processing, we break down its processes and handcraft them into a more transparent framework that we term as the Handcrafted Histological Transformer or H2T. Based on our experiments involving various datasets consisting of a total of 5,306 WSIs, the results demonstrate that H2T based holistic WSI-level representations offer competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods and can be readily utilized for various downstream analysis tasks. Finally, our results demonstrate that the H2T framework can be up to 14 times faster than the Transformer models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Continual Learning for Whole Slide Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10649v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, domain shift and task discrepancy between datasets can hinder effective knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a Target-Aware Knowledge Transfer framework, employing a teacher-student paradigm. Our framework enables the teacher model to learn common knowledge from the source and target domains by actively incorporating unlabelled target images into the training of the teacher model. The teacher bag features are subsequently adapted to supervise the training of the student model on the target domain. Despite incorporating the target features during training, the teacher model tends to overlook them under the inherent domain shift and task discrepancy. To alleviate this, we introduce a target-aware feature alignment module to establish a transferable latent relationship between the source and target features by solving the optimal transport problem. Experimental results show that models employing knowledge transfer outperform those trained from scratch, and our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among other knowledge transfer methods on various datasets, including TCGA-RCC, TCGA-NSCLC, and Camelyon16.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2024</p></details> |

Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches, typically used for the analysis of WSIs, divide the image (bag) into patches (instances), which are used to predict a single bag-level label. These approaches perform poorly in cytopathology slides due to a unique bag structure: sparsely located informative instances with varying characteristics of abnormality. We address these challenges by considering multiple types of labels: bag-level malignancy and ordered diagnostic scores, as well as instance-level informativeness and abnormality labels. We study their contribution beyond the MIL setting by proposing a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework, from which we derive a two-stage deep-learning-based algorithm. The algorithm identifies informative instances and assigns them local malignancy scores that are incorporated into a global malignancy prediction. We derive a lower bound of the MLE, leading to an improved training strategy based on weak supervision, that we motivate through statistical analysis. The lower bound further allows us to extend the proposed algorithm to simultaneously predict multiple bag and instance-level labels from a single output of a neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides competitive performance compared to several competing methods, achieves (expert) human-level performance, and allows augmentation of human decisions.</p></details> |  |

We describe a framework to design and train HookNet for achieving high-resolution semantic segmentation and introduce constraints to guarantee pixel-wise alignment in feature maps during hooking. We show the advantages of using HookNet in two histopathology image segmentation tasks where tissue type prediction accuracy strongly depends on contextual information, namely (1) multi-class tissue segmentation in breast cancer and, (2) segmentation of tertiary lymphoid structures and germinal centers in lung cancer.

Histology WSIs can have billions of pixels, which create enormous computational and annotation challenges. Typically, such images are divided into a set of patches (a bag of instances), where only bag-level class labels are provided. Deep learning based MIL methods calculate instance features using convolutional neural network (CNN). Our proposed approach is also deep learning based, with the following two contributions: Firstly, we propose to explicitly account for dependencies between instances during training by embedding self-attention Transformer blocks to capture dependencies between instances. For example, a tumor grade may depend on the presence of several particular patterns at different locations in WSI, which requires to account for dependencies between patches. Secondly, we propose an instance-wise loss function based on instance pseudo-labels. We compare the proposed algorithm to multiple baseline methods, evaluate it on the PANDA challenge dataset, the largest publicly available WSI dataset with over 11K images, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | MICCAI 2021 |

However, traditional feature extraction pipelines based on tools like CellProfiler often involve lengthy workflows, requiring WSI segmentation into patches, feature extraction at the patch level, and subsequent mapping back to the original WSI. To address these challenges, we present PySpatial, a high-speed pathomics toolkit specifically designed for WSI-level analysis. PySpatial streamlines the conventional pipeline by directly operating on computational regions of interest, reducing redundant processing steps. Utilizing rtree-based spatial indexing and matrix-based computation, PySpatial efficiently maps and processes computational regions, significantly accelerating feature extraction while maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments on two datasets-Perivascular Epithelioid Cell (PEC) and data from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP)-demonstrate substantial performance improvements. For smaller and sparse objects in PEC datasets, PySpatial achieves nearly a 10-fold speedup compared to standard CellProfiler pipelines. For larger objects, such as glomeruli and arteries in KPMP datasets, PySpatial achieves a 2-fold speedup. These results highlight PySpatial's potential to handle large-scale WSI analysis with enhanced efficiency and accuracy, paving the way for broader applications in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

As pioneering efforts, attention-based MIL (ABMIL) and its variants are increasingly becoming popular due to the characteristics of simultaneously handling clinical diagnosis and tumor localization. However, the attention mechanism exhibits limitations in discriminating between instances, which often misclassifies tissues and potentially impairs MIL performance. This paper proposes an Attribute-Driven MIL (AttriMIL) framework to address these issues. Concretely, we dissect the calculation process of ABMIL and present an attribute scoring mechanism that measures the contribution of each instance to bag prediction effectively, quantifying instance attributes. Based on attribute quantification, we develop a spatial attribute constraint and an attribute ranking constraint to model instance correlations within and across slides, respectively. These constraints encourage the network to capture the spatial correlation and semantic similarity of instances, improving the ability of AttriMIL to distinguish tissue types and identify challenging instances. Additionally, AttriMIL employs a histopathology adaptive backbone that maximizes the pre-trained model's feature extraction capability for collecting pathological features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our AttriMIL outperforms existing state-of-the-art frameworks across multiple evaluation metrics. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MedCAI/AttriMIL.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

However, in clinical practice, the continuously expanding size of WSI databases limits the practical application of the current CBHIR methods. In this paper, we propose a Lifelong Whole Slide Retrieval (LWSR) framework to address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting by progressive model updating on continuously growing retrieval database. Our framework aims to achieve the balance between stability and plasticity during continuous learning. To preserve system plasticity, we utilize local memory bank with reservoir sampling method to save instances, which can comprehensively encompass the feature spaces of both old and new tasks. Furthermore, A distance consistency rehearsal (DCR) module is designed to ensure the retrieval queue's consistency for previous tasks, which is regarded as stability within a lifelong CBHIR system.

It tends to be more difficult to detect by pathologists mainly due to its cellular morphology and diffuse invasion manner, and it has poor prognosis when detected at an advanced stage. Computational pathology tools that can assist pathologists in detecting SRCC would be of a massive benefit. In this paper, we trained deep learning models using transfer learning, fully-supervised learning, and weakly-supervised learning to predict SRCC in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using a training set of 1,765 WSIs. We evaluated the models on four different test sets of about 500 images each.

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance.

Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.</p></details> |  |

Pathology images provide a unique challenge for computer-vision-based analysis: a single pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) is gigapixel-sized and often contains hundreds of thousands to millions of objects of interest across multiple resolutions. In this work, we propose PathoLogy Universal TransfOrmer (PLUTO): a light-weight pathology FM that is pre-trained on a diverse dataset of 195 million image tiles collected from multiple sites and extracts meaningful representations across multiple WSI scales that enable a large variety of downstream pathology tasks. In particular, we design task-specific adaptation heads that utilize PLUTO's output embeddings for tasks which span pathology scales ranging from subcellular to slide-scale, including instance segmentation, tile classification, and slide-level prediction. We compare PLUTO's performance to other state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of external and internal benchmarks covering multiple biologically relevant tasks, tissue types, resolutions, stains, and scanners. We find that PLUTO matches or outperforms existing task-specific baselines and pathology-specific foundation models, some of which use orders-of-magnitude larger datasets and model sizes when compared to PLUTO. Our findings present a path towards a universal embedding to power pathology image analysis, and motivate further exploration around pathology foundation models in terms of data diversity, architectural improvements, sample efficiency, and practical deployability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We address this in two ways. First, we introduce Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, a novel diffusion model framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic pathological fetal and neonatal MRIs from semantic label images. Second, we enhance training data by modifying healthy label images through morphological alterations to simulate conditions such as ventriculomegaly, cerebellar and pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and microcephaly. By leveraging Fetal&Neonatal-DDPM, we synthesize realistic pathological MRIs from these modified pathological label images. Radiologists rated the synthetic MRIs as significantly (p < 0.05) superior in quality and diagnostic value compared to real MRIs, demonstrating features such as blood vessels and choroid plexus, and improved alignment with label annotations. Synthetic pathological data enhanced state-of-the-art nnUNet segmentation performance, particularly for severe ventriculomegaly cases, with the greatest improvements achieved in ventricle segmentation (Dice scores: 0.9253 vs. 0.7317). This study underscores the potential of generative AI as transformative tool for data augmentation, offering improved segmentation performance in pathological cases. This development represents a significant step towards improving analysis and segmentation accuracy in prenatal imaging, and also offers new ways for data anonymization through the generation of pathologic image data.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Anatomy-guided Pathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05844v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological structures in medical images are typically deviations from the expected anatomy of a patient. While clinicians consider this interplay between anatomy and pathology, recent deep learning algorithms specialize in recognizing either one of the two, rarely considering the patient's body from such a joint perspective. In this paper, we develop a generalist segmentation model that combines anatomical and pathological information, aiming to enhance the segmentation accuracy of pathological features. Our Anatomy-Pathology Exchange (APEx) training utilizes a query-based segmentation transformer which decodes a joint feature space into query-representations for human anatomy and interleaves them via a mixing strategy into the pathology-decoder for anatomy-informed pathology predictions. In doing so, we are able to report the best results across the board on FDG-PET-CT and Chest X-Ray pathology segmentation tasks with a margin of up to 3.3% as compared to strong baseline methods. Code and models will be publicly available at github.com/alexanderjaus/APEx.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathological Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12435v1)** | 2020-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Is it possible to develop an "AI Pathologist" to pass the board-certified examination of the American Board of Pathology (ABP)? To build such a system, three challenges need to be addressed. First, we need to create a visual question answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent is presented with a pathology image together with a question and is asked to give the correct answer. Due to privacy concerns, pathology images are usually not publicly available. Besides, only well-trained pathologists can understand pathology images, but they barely have time to help create datasets for AI research. The second challenge is: since it is difficult to hire highly experienced pathologists to create pathology visual questions and answers, the resulting pathology VQA dataset may contain errors. Training pathology VQA models using these noisy or even erroneous data will lead to problematic models that cannot generalize well on unseen images. The third challenge is: the medical concepts and knowledge covered in pathology question-answer (QA) pairs are very diverse while the number of QA pairs available for modeling training is limited. How to learn effective representations of diverse medical concepts based on limited data is technically demanding. In this paper, we aim to address these three challenges. To our best knowledge, our work represents the first one addressing the pathology VQA problem. To deal with the issue that a publicly available pathology VQA dataset is lacking, we create PathVQA dataset. To address the second challenge, we propose a learning-by-ignoring approach. To address the third challenge, we propose to use cross-modal self-supervised learning. We perform experiments on our created PathVQA dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learning-by-ignoring method and cross-modal self-supervised learning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2003.10286</p></details> |

Existing anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP. By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization, outperforming competing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[The Butterfly Effect in Pathology: Exploring Security in Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24141v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore, we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Jiashuai-Liu-hmos/Attack-WSI-pathology-foundation-models.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Whole Slide Scanners and the development of deep learning technologies have significantly advanced the field, leading to extensive research and development in pathology AI (Artificial Intelligence). These advancements have contributed to reducing the workload of pathologists and supporting decision-making in treatment plans. Recently, large-scale AI models known as Foundation Models (FMs), which are more accurate and applicable to a wide range of tasks compared to traditional AI, have emerged, and expanded their application scope in the healthcare field. Numerous FMs have been developed in pathology, and there are reported cases of their application in various tasks, such as disease diagnosis, rare cancer diagnosis, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker expression prediction, and the scoring of immunohistochemical expression intensity. However, several challenges remain for the clinical application of FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research is ongoing to address these challenges. In the future, it is expected that the development of Generalist Medical AI, which integrates pathology FMs with FMs from other medical domains, will progress, leading to the effective utilization of AI in real clinical settings to promote precision and personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Discovering Pathology Rationale and Token Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Pathology Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15687v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches. One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales, directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection. Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, building reliable normality models requires vast healthy datasets, as hospitals' data is inherently biased toward symptomatic populations, while privacy regulations hinder the assembly of representative healthy cohorts. To address this limitation, we propose PathoSCOPE, a few-shot unsupervised pathology detection framework that requires only a small set of non-pathological samples (minimum 2 shots), significantly improving data efficiency. We introduce Global-Local Contrastive Loss (GLCL), comprised of a Local Contrastive Loss to reduce the variability of non-pathological embeddings and a Global Contrastive Loss to enhance the discrimination of pathological regions. We also propose a Pathology-informed Embedding Generation (PiEG) module that synthesizes pathological embeddings guided by the global loss, better exploiting the limited non-pathological samples. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 and ChestXray8 datasets, PathoSCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency (2.48 GFLOPs, 166 FPS).</p></details> |  |

For case usage, these models were applied for the annotation tasks in clinician-oriented pathology reports for prostatectomy specimens. The true positive rate (TPR) for slides with prostate cancer was 99.7% by a false positive rate of 0.785%. The F1-scores of Gleason patterns reported in pathology reports ranged from 0.795 to 1.0 at the case level. TPR was 93.6% for the cribriform morphology and 72.6% for the ductal morphology. The correlation between the ground truth and the prediction for the relative tumor volume was 0.987 n. Our models cover the major components of prostate pathology and successfully accomplish the annotation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRASPing Anatomy to Improve Pathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03374v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates anatomical context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 16th MICCAI Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI2025)</p></details> |

In search towards such a robust voice pathology detection system we investigated 3 distinct classifiers within supervised learning and anomaly detection paradigms. We conducted a set of experiments using a variety of input data such as raw waveforms, spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and conventional acoustic (dysphonic) features (AF). In comparison with previously published works, this article is the first to utilize combination of 4 different databases comprising normophonic and pathological recordings of sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ unrestricted to a subset of vocal pathologies. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, this article is the first to explore gradient boosted trees and deep learning for this application. The following best classification performances measured by F1 score on dedicated test set were achieved: XGBoost (0.733) using AF and MFCC, DenseNet (0.621) using MFCC, and Isolation Forest (0.610) using AF. Even though these results are of exploratory character, conducted experiments do show promising potential of gradient boosting and deep learning methods to robustly detect voice pathologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 10 tables.

| **[GPC: Generative and General Pathology Image Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09035v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been increasingly incorporated into various computational pathology applications to improve its efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. Although successful, most previous approaches for image classification have crucial drawbacks. There exist numerous tasks in pathology, but one needs to build a model per task, i.e., a task-specific model, thereby increasing the number of models, training resources, and cost. Moreover, transferring arbitrary task-specific model to another task is still a challenging problem. Herein, we propose a task-agnostic generative and general pathology image classifier, so called GPC, that aims at learning from diverse kinds of pathology images and conducting numerous classification tasks in a unified model. GPC, equipped with a convolutional neural network and a Transformer-based language model, maps pathology images into a high-dimensional feature space and generates pertinent class labels as texts via the image-to-text classification mechanism. We evaluate GPC on six datasets for four different pathology image classification tasks. Experimental results show that GPC holds considerable potential for developing an effective and efficient universal model for pathology image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI-MedAGI 2023 (Best Paper Honorable Mention)</p></details> |
| **[CAMP: Continuous and Adaptive Learning Model in Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09030v1)** | 2024-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There exist numerous diagnostic tasks in pathology. Conventional computational pathology formulates and tackles them as independent and individual image classification problems, thereby resulting in computational inefficiency and high costs. To address the challenges, we propose a generic, unified, and universal framework, called a continuous and adaptive learning model in pathology (CAMP), for pathology image classification. CAMP is a generative, efficient, and adaptive classification model that can continuously adapt to any classification task by leveraging pathology-specific prior knowledge and learning taskspecific knowledge with minimal computational cost and without forgetting the knowledge from the existing tasks. We evaluated CAMP on 22 datasets, including 1,171,526 patches and 11,811 pathology slides, across 17 classification tasks. CAMP achieves state-of-theart classification performance on a wide range of datasets and tasks at both patch- and slide-levels and reduces up to 94% of computation time and 85% of storage memory in comparison to the conventional classification models. Our results demonstrate that CAMP can offer a fundamental transformation in pathology image classification, paving the way for the fully digitized and computerized pathology practice.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Remote Pathological Gait Classification System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.01634v1)** | 2021-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several pathologies can alter the way people walk, i.e. their gait. Gait analysis can therefore be used to detect impairments and help diagnose illnesses and assess patient recovery. Using vision-based systems, diagnoses could be done at home or in a clinic, with the needed computation being done remotely. State-of-the-art vision-based gait analysis systems use deep learning, requiring large datasets for training. However, to our best knowledge, the biggest publicly available pathological gait dataset contains only 10 subjects, simulating 4 gait pathologies. This paper presents a new dataset called GAIT-IT, captured from 21 subjects simulating 4 gait pathologies, with 2 severity levels, besides normal gait, being considerably larger than publicly available gait pathology datasets, allowing to train a deep learning model for gait pathology classification. Moreover, it was recorded in a professional studio, making it possible to obtain nearly perfect silhouettes, free of segmentation errors. Recognizing the importance of remote healthcare, this paper proposes a prototype of a web application allowing to upload a walking person's video, possibly acquired using a smartphone camera, and execute a web service that classifies the person's gait as normal or across different pathologies. The web application has a user friendly interface and could be used by healthcare professionals or other end users. An automatic gait analysis system is also developed and integrated with the web application for pathology classification. Compared to state-of-the-art solutions, it achieves a drastic reduction in the number of model parameters, which means significantly lower memory requirements, as well as lower training and execution times. Classification accuracy is on par with the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

This trend reversal occurs for certain choices of the regularization parameter for model training, namely, if the parameter is contained in what we call the pathological regularization regime. For ridge regression, we give necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions on the dataset for the existence of a pathological regularization regime. Moreover, our results provide a data science practitioner with a hands-on tool to avoid hyperparameter choices suffering from trend reversal. We furthermore present numerical results on pathological regularization regimes for logistic regression. Finally, we draw connections to datasets exhibiting Simpson's paradox, providing a natural source of pathological datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the performance of the hybrid variational autoencoder (VAE)-non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model for SE, focusing primarily on its generalizability to pathological speakers with Parkinson's disease. We show that VAE models trained on large neurotypical datasets perform poorly on pathological speech. While fine-tuning these pre-trained models with pathological speech improves performance, a performance gap remains between neurotypical and pathological speakers. To address this gap, we propose using personalized SE models derived from fine-tuning pre-trained models with only a few seconds of clean data from each speaker. Our results demonstrate that personalized models considerably enhance performance for all speakers, achieving comparable results for both neurotypical and pathological speakers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

Cellular nuclei segmentation can segment various types of cells for downstream analysis, but it relies on predefined categories and lacks flexibility. Moreover, pathology visual question answering can perform image-level understanding but lacks region-level detection capability. To address this, we propose a new benchmark called Pathology Visual Grounding (PathVG), which aims to detect regions based on expressions with different attributes. To evaluate PathVG, we create a new dataset named RefPath which contains 27,610 images with 33,500 language-grounded boxes. Compared to visual grounding in other domains, PathVG presents pathological images at multi-scale and contains expressions with pathological knowledge. In the experimental study, we found that the biggest challenge was the implicit information underlying the pathological expressions. Based on this, we proposed Pathology Knowledge-enhanced Network (PKNet) as the baseline model for PathVG. PKNet leverages the knowledge-enhancement capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert pathological terms with implicit information into explicit visual features, and fuses knowledge features with expression features through the designed Knowledge Fusion Module (KFM). The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PathVG benchmark.</p></details> | 10pages, 4figures |

However, annotating pathology bounding boxes is a time-consuming task such that large public datasets for this purpose are scarce. Current approaches thus use weakly supervised object detection to learn the (rough) localization of pathologies from image-level annotations, which is however limited in performance due to the lack of bounding box supervision. We therefore propose anatomy-driven pathology detection (ADPD), which uses easy-to-annotate bounding boxes of anatomical regions as proxies for pathologies. We study two training approaches: supervised training using anatomy-level pathology labels and multiple instance learning (MIL) with image-level pathology labels. Our results show that our anatomy-level training approach outperforms weakly supervised methods and fully supervised detection with limited training samples, and our MIL approach is competitive with both baseline approaches, therefore demonstrating the potential of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2023</p></details> |

Histopathology images are large and need to be split up into image tiles or patches so modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can process them. In this work, we present a method to generate an interpretable image representation of computational pathology images using quadtrees and a pipeline to use these representations for highly accurate downstream classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use quadtrees for pathology image data. We show it is highly accurate, able to achieve as good results as the currently widely adopted tissue mask patch extraction methods all while using over 38% less data.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, accepted to CDPath ICCV 2021</p></details> |
| **[Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16660v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.</p></details> | 38 Pages, 8 Figures |

However, collecting training data is challenging. Semi-supervised approaches by combining labelled and unlabelled data can offer a solution to data scarcity. An approach to semi-supervised learning relies on reconstruction objectives (as self-supervision objectives) that learns in a joint fashion suitable representations for the task. Here, we propose Anatomy-Pathology Disentanglement Network (APD-Net), a pathology segmentation model that attempts to learn jointly for the first time: disentanglement of anatomy, modality, and pathology. The model is trained in a semi-supervised fashion with new reconstruction losses directly aiming to improve pathology segmentation with limited annotations. In addition, a joint optimization strategy is proposed to fully take advantage of the available annotations. We evaluate our methods with two private cardiac infarction segmentation datasets with LGE-MRI scans. APD-Net can perform pathology segmentation with few annotations, maintain performance with different amounts of supervision, and outperform related deep learning methods.</p></details> | 12 Pages, 4 figures |

These approaches are typically designed and evaluated for phonetically-controlled speech scenarios, where speakers are prompted to articulate identical phonetic content. While gathering controlled speech recordings can be laborious, spontaneous speech can be conveniently acquired as potential patients navigate their daily routines. Further, spontaneous speech can be valuable in detecting subtle and abstract cues of pathological speech. Nonetheless, the efficacy of automatic pathological speech detection for spontaneous speech remains unexplored. This paper analyzes the influence of speech mode on pathological speech detection approaches, examining two distinct categories of approaches, i.e., classical machine learning and deep learning. Results indicate that classical approaches may struggle to capture pathology-discriminant cues in spontaneous speech. In contrast, deep learning approaches demonstrate superior performance, managing to extract additional cues that were previously inaccessible in non-spontaneous speech</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in EUSIPCO 2024</p></details> |

However, standard ML models often lack the rigorous evaluation required for clinical decisions. Machine learning techniques for natural images are ill-equipped to deal with pathology images that are significantly large and noisy, require expensive labeling, are hard to interpret, and are susceptible to spurious correlations. We propose a set of practical guidelines for ML evaluation in pathology that address the above concerns. The paper includes measures for setting up the evaluation framework, effectively dealing with variability in labels, and a recommended suite of tests to address issues related to domain shift, robustness, and confounding variables. We hope that the proposed framework will bridge the gap between ML researchers and domain experts, leading to wider adoption of ML techniques in pathology and improving patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2022 ML Evaluation Workshop</p></details> |

However, the application of AI to support medical diagnostics in clinical routine comes with many challenges. The algorithms should have high prediction accuracy but also be transparent, understandable and reliable. Thus, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is highly relevant for this domain. We present a survey on XAI within digital pathology, a medical imaging sub-discipline with particular characteristics and needs. The review includes several contributions. Firstly, we give a thorough overview of current XAI techniques of potential relevance for deep learning methods in pathology imaging, and categorise them from three different aspects. In doing so, we incorporate uncertainty estimation methods as an integral part of the XAI landscape. We also connect the technical methods to the specific prerequisites in digital pathology and present findings to guide future research efforts. The survey is intended for both technical researchers and medical professionals, one of the objectives being to establish a common ground for cross-disciplinary discussions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Self-Supervised Learning on Diverse Pathology Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04690v2)** | 2023-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology can lead to saving human lives, but models are annotation hungry and pathology images are notoriously expensive to annotate. Self-supervised learning has shown to be an effective method for utilizing unlabeled data, and its application to pathology could greatly benefit its downstream tasks. Yet, there are no principled studies that compare SSL methods and discuss how to adapt them for pathology. To address this need, we execute the largest-scale study of SSL pre-training on pathology image data, to date. Our study is conducted using 4 representative SSL methods on diverse downstream tasks. We establish that large-scale domain-aligned pre-training in pathology consistently out-performs ImageNet pre-training in standard SSL settings such as linear and fine-tuning evaluations, as well as in low-label regimes. Moreover, we propose a set of domain-specific techniques that we experimentally show leads to a performance boost. Lastly, for the first time, we apply SSL to the challenging task of nuclei instance segmentation and show large and consistent performance improvements under diverse settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2023</p></details> |

Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |
| **[PathoTune: Adapting Visual Foundation Model to Pathological Specialists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16497v2)** | 2024-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As natural image understanding moves towards the pretrain-finetune era, research in pathology imaging is concurrently evolving. Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing. The code is available at https://github.com/openmedlab/PathoDuet.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 |

Foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have been recently proposed for universal use in segmentation tasks. SAM shows remarkable promise in instance segmentation on natural images. However, the applicability of SAM to computational pathology tasks is limited due to the following factors: (1) lack of comprehensive pathology datasets used in SAM training and (2) the design of SAM is not inherently optimized for semantic segmentation tasks. In this work, we adapt SAM for semantic segmentation by introducing trainable class prompts, followed by further enhancements through the incorporation of a pathology encoder, specifically a pathology foundation model. Our framework, SAM-Path enhances SAM's ability to conduct semantic segmentation in digital pathology without human input prompts. Through experiments on two public pathology datasets, the BCSS and the CRAG datasets, we demonstrate that the fine-tuning with trainable class prompts outperforms vanilla SAM with manual prompts and post-processing by 27.52% in Dice score and 71.63% in IOU. On these two datasets, the proposed additional pathology foundation model further achieves a relative improvement of 5.07% to 5.12% in Dice score and 4.50% to 8.48% in IOU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MedAGI 2023</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Pathology Foundation Models: Adaptation Strategies and Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16038v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, several foundation models have recently emerged and demonstrated enhanced learning capability for analyzing pathology images. However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis.

| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15362v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages |

Data augmentation emerges as a crucial technique to mitigate this limitation. In this study, we introduce an efficient data augmentation method for pathology images, called USegMix. Given a set of pathology images, the proposed method generates a new, synthetic image in two phases. In the first phase, USegMix constructs a pool of tissue segments in an automated and unsupervised manner using superpixels and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In the second phase, USegMix selects a candidate segment in a target image, replaces it with a similar segment from the segment pool, and blends them by using a pre-trained diffusion model. In this way, USegMix can generate diverse and realistic pathology images. We rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of USegMix on two pathology image datasets of colorectal and prostate cancers. The results demonstrate improvements in cancer classification performance, underscoring the substantial potential of USegMix for pathology image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Among them, crowdsourcing has attracted researchers' attention in the recent years, allowing them to engage thousands of untrained individuals in research and diagnosis. While there exist several articles in this regard, prior works have not collectively documented them. We, therefore, aim to review the applications of crowdsourcing in human pathology in a semi-systematic manner. We firstly, introduce a novel method to do a systematic search of the literature. Utilizing this method, we, then, collect hundreds of articles and screen them against a pre-defined set of criteria. Furthermore, we crowdsource part of the screening process, to examine another potential application of crowdsourcing. Finally, we review the selected articles and characterize the prior uses of crowdsourcing in pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking adaptive digital pathology through dynamic feature learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20430v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized the paradigm of digital pathology, as they leverage general-purpose features to emulate real-world pathological practices, enabling the quantitative analysis of critical histological patterns and the dissection of cancer-specific signals. However, these static general features constrain the flexibility and pathological relevance in the ever-evolving needs of clinical applications, hindering the broad use of the current models. Here we introduce PathFiT, a dynamic feature learning method that can be effortlessly plugged into various pathology foundation models to unlock their adaptability. Meanwhile, PathFiT performs seamless implementation across diverse pathology applications regardless of downstream specificity. To validate PathFiT, we construct a digital pathology benchmark with over 20 terabytes of Internet and real-world data comprising 28 H\&E-stained tasks and 7 specialized imaging tasks including Masson's Trichrome staining and immunofluorescence images. By applying PathFiT to the representative pathology foundation models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 34 out of 35 tasks, with significant improvements on 23 tasks and outperforming by 10.20% on specialized imaging tasks. The superior performance and versatility of PathFiT open up new avenues in computational pathology.</p></details> | 49 pages, 14 figures |
| **[A Computer-Aided Diagnosis System for Breast Pathology: A Deep Learning Approach with Model Interpretability from Pathological Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02656v1)** | 2021-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: We develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using deep learning approaches for lesion detection and classification on whole-slide images (WSIs) with breast cancer. The deep features being distinguishing in classification from the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are demonstrated in this study to provide comprehensive interpretability for the proposed CAD system using pathological knowledge. Methods: In the experiment, a total of 186 slides of WSIs were collected and classified into three categories: Non-Carcinoma, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). Instead of conducting pixel-wise classification into three classes directly, we designed a hierarchical framework with the multi-view scheme that performs lesion detection for region proposal at higher magnification first and then conducts lesion classification at lower magnification for each detected lesion. Results: The slide-level accuracy rate for three-category classification reaches 90.8% (99/109) through 5-fold cross-validation and achieves 94.8% (73/77) on the testing set. The experimental results show that the morphological characteristics and co-occurrence properties learned by the deep learning models for lesion classification are accordant with the clinical rules in diagnosis. Conclusion: The pathological interpretability of the deep features not only enhances the reliability of the proposed CAD system to gain acceptance from medical specialists, but also facilitates the development of deep learning frameworks for various tasks in pathology. Significance: This paper presents a CAD system for pathological image analysis, which fills the clinical requirements and can be accepted by medical specialists with providing its interpretability from the pathological perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology Image Restoration via Mixture of Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12399v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In digital pathology, acquiring all-in-focus images is essential to high-quality imaging and high-efficient clinical workflow. Traditional scanners achieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then merging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue defocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to restore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes. However, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate defocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic complexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution cascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in preserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly propose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial prompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that describe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the fine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by feeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology images from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture of prompts to clinical usage.

| **[Pathology Segmentation using Distributional Differences to Images of Healthy Origin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10344v2)** | 2019-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fully supervised segmentation methods require a large training cohort of already segmented images, providing information at the pixel level of each image. We present a method to automatically segment and model pathologies in medical images, trained solely on data labelled on the image level as either healthy or containing a visual defect. We base our method on CycleGAN, an image-to-image translation technique, to translate images between the domains of healthy and pathological images. We extend the core idea with two key contributions. Implementing the generators as residual generators allows us to explicitly model the segmentation of the pathology. Realizing the translation from the healthy to the pathological domain using a variational autoencoder allows us to specify one representation of the pathology, as this transformation is otherwise not unique. Our model hence not only allows us to create pixelwise semantic segmentations, it is also able to create inpaintings for the segmentations to render the pathological image healthy. Furthermore, we can draw new unseen pathology samples from this model based on the distribution in the data. We show quantitatively, that our method is able to segment pathologies with a surprising accuracy being only slightly inferior to a state-of-the-art fully supervised method, although the latter has per-pixel rather than per-image training information. Moreover, we show qualitative results of both the segmentations and inpaintings. Our findings motivate further research into weakly-supervised segmentation using image level annotations, allowing for faster and cheaper acquisition of training data without a large sacrifice in segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

Compared to other medical images, pathology images are more difficult to annotate, and thus, there is an extreme lack of available datasets for conducting supervised learning to train robust deep learning models. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) model, the global contrast-masked autoencoder (GCMAE), which can train the encoder to have the ability to represent local-global features of pathological images, also significantly improve the performance of transfer learning across data sets. In this study, the ability of the GCMAE to learn migratable representations was demonstrated through extensive experiments using a total of three different disease-specific hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained pathology datasets: Camelyon16, NCTCRC and BreakHis. In addition, this study designed an effective automated pathology diagnosis process based on the GCMAE for clinical applications.

To address this, we frame pathology detection as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pretraining, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our fully self-supervised model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Furthermore, in a supervised fine-tuning setting, Screener surpasses existing self-supervised pretraining methods, establishing it as a state-of-the-art foundation for pathology segmentation. The code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Since hyperspectral pathology images benefit from the rich and detailed spectral information even beyond the visible spectrum, the key to achieve high-precision hyperspectral pathology image segmentation is to felicitously model the context along high-dimensional spectral bands. Inspired by the strong context modeling ability of transformers, we hereby, for the first time, formulate the contextual feature learning across spectral bands for hyperspectral pathology image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction procedure by transformers. To assist spectral context learning procedure, we introduce two important strategies: (1) a sparsity scheme enforces the learned contextual relationship to be sparse, so as to eliminates the distraction from the redundant bands; (2) a spectral normalization, a separate group normalization for each spectral band, mitigates the nuisance caused by heterogeneous underlying distributions of bands. We name our method Spectral Transformer (SpecTr), which enjoys two benefits: (1) it has a strong ability to model long-range dependency among spectral bands, and (2) it jointly explores the spatial-spectral features of HSI. Experiments show that SpecTr outperforms other competing methods in a hyperspectral pathology image segmentation benchmark without the need of pre-training.

However, computational pathology provides a deeper understanding of brain disorders at cellular level, able to consolidate a diagnosis and make the bridge between the medical image and the omics analysis. In traditional histopathology, histology slides are visually inspected, under the microscope, by trained pathologists. This process is time-consuming and labor-intensive; therefore, the emergence of Computational Pathology has triggered great hope to ease this tedious task and make it more robust. This chapter focuses on understanding the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques used to analyze whole slide images within the context of brain disorders. We present a selective set of remarkable machine learning algorithms providing discriminative approaches and quality results on brain disorders. These methodologies are applied to different tasks, such as monitoring mechanisms contributing to disease progression and patient survival rates, analyzing morphological phenotypes for classification and quantitative assessment of disease, improving clinical care, diagnosing tumor specimens, and intraoperative interpretation.

Traditional methods like laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice pathologies using phonation data. Phonation data from the Saarbrücken Voice Database are analyzed using acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures signal quality. Scale-based features, such as Hölder and Hurst exponents, further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies. The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and improving patient outcomes.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 11 Figures |

However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming. In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved histological fidelity. This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual staining technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures.

The digital pathology platform can make the pathological resources digital and networked, and realize the permanent storage of visual data and the synchronous browsing processing without the limitation of time and space. It has been widely used in various fields of pathology. However, there is still a lack of an open and universal digital pathology platform to assist doctors in the management and analysis of digital pathological sections, as well as the management and structured description of relevant patient information. Most platforms cannot integrate image viewing, annotation and analysis, and text information management. To solve the above problems, we propose a comprehensive and extensible platform PIMIP. Our PIMIP has developed the image annotation functions based on the visualization of digital pathological sections. Our annotation functions support multi-user collaborative annotation and multi-device annotation, and realize the automation of some annotation tasks. In the annotation task, we invited a professional pathologist for guidance. We introduce a machine learning module for image analysis. The data we collected included public data from local hospitals and clinical examples. Our platform is more clinical and suitable for clinical use. In addition to image data, we also structured the management and display of text information. So our platform is comprehensive.

| **[Automatic Classification of Pathology Reports using TF-IDF Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07406v1)** | 2019-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Pathology report is arguably one of the most important documents in medicine containing interpretive information about the visual findings from the patient's biopsy sample. Each pathology report has a retention period of up to 20 years after the treatment of a patient. Cancer registries process and encode high volumes of free-text pathology reports for surveillance of cancer and tumor diseases all across the world. In spite of their extremely valuable information they hold, pathology reports are not used in any systematic way to facilitate computational pathology. Therefore, in this study, we investigate automated machine-learning techniques to identify/predict the primary diagnosis (based on ICD-O code) from pathology reports. We performed experiments by extracting the TF-IDF features from the reports and classifying them using three different methods---SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. We constructed a new dataset with 1,949 pathology reports arranged into 37 ICD-O categories, collected from four different primary sites, namely lung, kidney, thymus, and testis. The reports were manually transcribed into text format after collecting them as PDF files from NCI Genomic Data Commons public dataset. We subsequently pre-processed the reports by removing irrelevant textual artifacts produced by OCR software. The highest classification accuracy we achieved was 92\% using XGBoost classifier on TF-IDF feature vectors, the linear SVM scored 87\% accuracy. Furthermore, the study shows that TF-IDF vectors are suitable for highlighting the important keywords within a report which can be helpful for the cancer research and diagnostic workflow. The results are encouraging in demonstrating the potential of machine learning methods for classification and encoding of pathology reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Articulatory Features for ASR of Pathological Speech](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10948v1)** | 2018-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the joint use of articulatory and acoustic features for automatic speech recognition (ASR) of pathological speech. Despite long-lasting efforts to build speaker- and text-independent ASR systems for people with dysarthria, the performance of state-of-the-art systems is still considerably lower on this type of speech than on normal speech. The most prominent reason for the inferior performance is the high variability in pathological speech that is characterized by the spectrotemporal deviations caused by articulatory impairments due to various etiologies. To cope with this high variation, we propose to use speech representations which utilize articulatory information together with the acoustic properties. A designated acoustic model, namely a fused-feature-map convolutional neural network (fCNN), which performs frequency convolution on acoustic features and time convolution on articulatory features is trained and tested on a Dutch and a Flemish pathological speech corpus. The ASR performance of fCNN-based ASR system using joint features is compared to other neural network architectures such conventional CNNs and time-frequency convolutional networks (TFCNNs) in several training scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at Interspeech 2018</p></details> |

To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives, these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patch Stitching Data Augmentation for Cancer Classification in Pathology Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16162v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, integrating computational methods and digital imaging, has shown to be effective in advancing disease diagnosis and prognosis. In recent years, the development of machine learning and deep learning has greatly bolstered the power of computational pathology. However, there still remains the issue of data scarcity and data imbalance, which can have an adversarial effect on any computational method. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and effective data augmentation strategy to generate new pathology images from the existing pathology images and thus enrich datasets without additional data collection or annotation costs. To evaluate the proposed method, we employed two sets of colorectal cancer datasets and obtained improved classification results, suggesting that the proposed simple approach holds the potential for alleviating the data scarcity and imbalance in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

The integration of high-throughput data including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, pathomics, and radiomics into clinical practice improves cancer treatment plans, treatment cycles, and cure rates, and helps doctors open up innovative approaches to patient prognosis. In the past decade, rapid advances in artificial intelligence, chip design and manufacturing, and mobile computing have facilitated research in computational pathology and have the potential to provide better-integrated solutions for whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics. However, tumor computational pathology now brings some challenges to the application of tumour screening, diagnosis and prognosis in terms of data integration, hardware processing, network sharing bandwidth and machine learning technology. This review investigates image preprocessing methods in computational pathology from a pathological and technical perspective, machine learning-based methods, and applications of computational pathology in breast, colon, prostate, lung, and various tumour disease scenarios. Finally, the challenges and prospects of machine learning in computational pathology applications are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[PEPSI: Pathology-Enhanced Pulse-Sequence-Invariant Representations for Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06227v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable progress has been made by data-driven machine-learning methods in the analysis of MRI scans. However, most existing MRI analysis approaches are crafted for specific MR pulse sequences (MR contrasts) and usually require nearly isotropic acquisitions. This limits their applicability to diverse real-world clinical data, where scans commonly exhibit variations in appearances due to being obtained with varying sequence parameters, resolutions, and orientations -- especially in the presence of pathology. In this paper, we propose PEPSI, the first pathology-enhanced, and pulse-sequence-invariant feature representation learning model for brain MRI. PEPSI is trained entirely on synthetic images with a novel pathology encoding strategy, and enables co-training across datasets with diverse pathologies and missing modalities. Despite variations in pathology appearances across different MR pulse sequences or the quality of acquired images (e.g., resolution, orientation, artifacts, etc), PEPSI produces a high-resolution image of reference contrast (MP-RAGE) that captures anatomy, along with an image specifically highlighting the pathology. Our experiments demonstrate PEPSI's remarkable capability for image synthesis compared with the state-of-the-art, contrast-agnostic synthesis models, as it accurately reconstructs anatomical structures while differentiating between pathology and normal tissue. We further illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PEPSI features for downstream pathology segmentations on five public datasets covering white matter hyperintensities and stroke lesions. Code is available at https://github.com/peirong26/PEPSI.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Cure for Pathological Behavior in Games that Use Minimax](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3444v1)** | 2013-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional approach to choosing moves in game-playing programs is the minimax procedure. The general belief underlying its use is that increasing search depth improves play. Recent research has shown that given certain simplifying assumptions about a game tree's structure, this belief is erroneous: searching deeper decreases the probability of making a correct move. This phenomenon is called game tree pathology. Among these simplifying assumptions is uniform depth of win/loss (terminal) nodes, a condition which is not true for most real games. Analytic studies in [10] have shown that if every node in a pathological game tree is made terminal with probability exceeding a certain threshold, the resulting tree is nonpathological. This paper considers a new evaluation function which recognizes increasing densities of forced wins at deeper levels in the tree. This property raises two points that strengthen the hypothesis that uniform win depth causes pathology. First, it proves mathematically that as search deepens, an evaluation function that does not explicitly check for certain forced win patterns becomes decreasingly likely to force wins. This failing predicts the pathological behavior of the original evaluation function. Second, it shows empirically that despite recognizing fewer mid-game wins than the theoretically predicted minimum, the new function is nonpathological.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of the First Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1985)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Modality Pathology Segmentation Framework: Application to Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05780v1)** | 2020-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-sequence of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images can provide complementary information for myocardial pathology (scar and edema). However, it is still challenging to fuse these underlying information for pathology segmentation effectively. This work presents an automatic cascade pathology segmentation framework based on multi-modality CMR images. It mainly consists of two neural networks: an anatomical structure segmentation network (ASSN) and a pathological region segmentation network (PRSN). Specifically, the ASSN aims to segment the anatomical structure where the pathology may exist, and it can provide a spatial prior for the pathological region segmentation. In addition, we integrate a denoising auto-encoder (DAE) into the ASSN to generate segmentation results with plausible shapes. The PRSN is designed to segment pathological region based on the result of ASSN, in which a fusion block based on channel attention is proposed to better aggregate multi-modality information from multi-modality CMR images. Experiments from the MyoPS2020 challenge dataset show that our framework can achieve promising performance for myocardial scar and edema segmentation.</p></details> | 12 pages,MyoPS 2020 |

However, deep federated learning is an opportunity to create datasets that reflect the data diversity of many laboratories. Further, the effort of dataset construction can be divided among many. Unfortunately, existing algorithms cannot be easily applied to computational pathology since previous work presupposes that data distributions of laboratories must be similar. This is an unlikely assumption, mainly since different laboratories have different staining styles. As a solution, we propose BottleGAN, a generative model that can computationally align the staining styles of many laboratories and can be trained in a privacy-preserving manner to foster federated learning in computational pathology. We construct a heterogenic multi-institutional dataset based on the PESO segmentation dataset and improve the IOU by 42\% compared to existing federated learning algorithms.

Because of the irregular shape and small area, pathological segmentation has always been a challenging task. We propose an anatomy prior based framework, which combines the U-net segmentation network with the attention technique. Leveraging the fact that the pathology is inclusive, we propose a neighborhood penalty strategy to gauge the inclusion relationship between the myocardium and the myocardial infarction and no-reflow areas. This neighborhood penalty strategy can be applied to any two labels with inclusive relationships (such as the whole infarction and myocardium, etc.) to form a neighboring loss. The proposed framework is evaluated on the EMIDEC dataset. Results show that our framework is effective in pathological area segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, to be published in STACOM 2020 (MICCAI Workshop)</p></details> |

In this work, we present our scalable training pipeline for large pathology imaging data, and a comprehensive analysis of various hyperparameter choices and training techniques for building pathology FMs. We release and make publicly available the first batch of our pathology FMs (https://github.com/kaiko-ai/towards_large_pathology_fms) trained on open-access TCGA whole slide images, a commonly used collection of pathology images. The experimental evaluation shows that our models reach state-of-the-art performance on various patch-level downstream tasks, ranging from breast cancer subtyping to colorectal nuclear segmentation. Finally, to unify the evaluation approaches used in the field and to simplify future comparisons of different FMs, we present an open-source framework (https://github.com/kaiko-ai/eva) designed for the consistent evaluation of pathology FMs across various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Self-Supervised Similarity Learning for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08139v3)** | 2020-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using features extracted from networks pretrained on ImageNet is a common practice in applications of deep learning for digital pathology. However it presents the downside of missing domain specific image information. In digital pathology, supervised training data is expensive and difficult to collect. We propose a self-supervised method for feature extraction by similarity learning on whole slide images (WSI) that is simple to implement and allows creation of robust and compact image descriptors. We train a siamese network, exploiting image spatial continuity and assuming spatially adjacent tiles in the image are more similar to each other than distant tiles. Our network outputs feature vectors of length 128, which allows dramatically lower memory storage and faster processing than networks pretrained on ImageNet. We apply the method on digital pathology WSIs from the Camelyon16 train set and assess and compare our method by measuring image retrieval of tumor tiles and descriptor pair distance ratio for distant/near tiles in the Camelyon16 test set. We show that our method yields better retrieval task results than existing ImageNet based and generic self-supervised feature extraction methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first published method for self-supervised learning tailored for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything in Pathology Images with Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20988v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology image segmentation is crucial in computational pathology for analyzing histological features relevant to cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg, the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 21 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Neural Network Based Respiratory Pathology Classification Using Cough Sounds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12174v1)** | 2021-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent systems are transforming the world, as well as our healthcare system. We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that can distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). In order to train a deep neural network model, we collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician's diagnosis. The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology), reaches accuracy exceeding 84\% when classifying cough to the label provided by the physicians' diagnosis. In order to classify subject's respiratory pathology condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the fact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy the same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-channel Prototype Network for few-shot Classification of Pathological Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07871v1)** | 2023-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pathology, the rarity of certain diseases and the complexity in annotating pathological images significantly hinder the creation of extensive, high-quality datasets. This limitation impedes the progress of deep learning-assisted diagnostic systems in pathology. Consequently, it becomes imperative to devise a technology that can discern new disease categories from a minimal number of annotated examples. Such a technology would substantially advance deep learning models for rare diseases. Addressing this need, we introduce the Dual-channel Prototype Network (DCPN), rooted in the few-shot learning paradigm, to tackle the challenge of classifying pathological images with limited samples. DCPN augments the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT) framework for few-shot classification via self-supervised learning and integrates it with convolutional neural networks. This combination forms a dual-channel architecture that extracts multi-scale, highly precise pathological features. The approach enhances the versatility of prototype representations and elevates the efficacy of prototype networks in few-shot pathological image classification tasks. We evaluated DCPN using three publicly available pathological datasets, configuring small-sample classification tasks that mirror varying degrees of clinical scenario domain shifts. Our experimental findings robustly affirm DCPN's superiority in few-shot pathological image classification, particularly in tasks within the same domain, where it achieves the benchmarks of supervised learning.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance Migration Diffusion for Nuclear Instance Segmentation in Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01577v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear instance segmentation plays a vital role in disease diagnosis within digital pathology. However, limited labeled data in pathological images restricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance Migration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate more varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and internuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration Module (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process of nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an Internuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear spatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above, IM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts and internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks. Evaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images generated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation performance. Code will be made public later.</p></details> |  |

The recent developments of artificial neural networks in computational pathology have shown that these methods hold great potential for improving the accuracy and quality of cancer diagnosis. However, the issues with the robustness and reliability of such methods have not been fully resolved yet. Herein, we propose a centroid-aware feature recalibration network that can conduct cancer grading in an accurate and robust manner. The proposed network maps an input pathology image into an embedding space and adjusts it by using centroids embedding vectors of different cancer grades via attention mechanism. Equipped with the recalibrated embedding vector, the proposed network classifiers the input pathology image into a pertinent class label, i.e., cancer grade. We evaluate the proposed network using colorectal cancer datasets that were collected under different environments. The experimental results confirm that the proposed network is able to conduct cancer grading in pathology images with high accuracy regardless of the environmental changes in the datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2023; 10 pages; 1 figure; Project code: https://github.com/colin19950703/CaFeNet</p></details> |

In response, speaker anonymization aims to conceal personally identifiable information while retaining crucial linguistic content. However, the application of anonymization techniques to pathological speech, a critical area where privacy is especially vital, has not been extensively examined. This study investigates anonymization's impact on pathological speech across over 2,700 speakers from multiple German institutions, focusing on privacy, pathological utility, and demographic fairness. We explore both deep-learning-based and signal processing-based anonymization methods. We document substantial privacy improvements across disorders-evidenced by equal error rate increases up to 1933%, with minimal overall impact on utility. Specific disorders such as Dysarthria, Dysphonia, and Cleft Lip and Palate experience minimal utility changes, while Dysglossia shows slight improvements. Our findings underscore that the impact of anonymization varies substantially across different disorders. This necessitates disorder-specific anonymization strategies to optimally balance privacy with diagnostic utility. Additionally, our fairness analysis reveals consistent anonymization effects across most of the demographics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of anonymization in pathological speech for enhancing privacy, while also highlighting the importance of customized and disorder-specific approaches to account for inversion attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Communications Medicine</p></details> |

With the proposal of Segment Anything Model (SAM), more and more foundation models have seen rapid development in the field of image segmentation. Recently, SAM2 has garnered widespread attention in both natural image and medical image segmentation. Compared to SAM, it has significantly improved in terms of segmentation accuracy and generalization performance. We compared the foundational models based on SAM and found that their performance in semantic segmentation of pathological images was hardly satisfactory. In this paper, we propose Path-SAM2, which for the first time adapts the SAM2 model to cater to the task of pathological semantic segmentation. We integrate the largest pretrained vision encoder for histopathology (UNI) with the original SAM2 encoder, adding more pathology-based prior knowledge. Additionally, we introduce a learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) classification module to replace the manual prompt process. In three adenoma pathological datasets, Path-SAM2 has achieved state-of-the-art performance.This study demonstrates the great potential of adapting SAM2 to pathology image segmentation tasks.

Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Pathological Speech Analysis with Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04142v1)** | 2024-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological speech analysis has been of interest in the detection of certain diseases like depression and Alzheimer's disease and attracts much interest from researchers. However, previous pathological speech analysis models are commonly designed for a specific disease while overlooking the connection between diseases, which may constrain performance and lower training efficiency. Instead of fine-tuning deep models for different tasks, prompt tuning is a much more efficient training paradigm. We thus propose a unified pathological speech analysis system for as many as three diseases with the prompt tuning technique. This system uses prompt tuning to adjust only a small part of the parameters to detect different diseases from speeches of possible patients. Our system leverages a pre-trained spoken language model and demonstrates strong performance across multiple disorders while only fine-tuning a fraction of the parameters. This efficient training approach leads to faster convergence and improved F1 scores by allowing knowledge to be shared across tasks. Our experiments on Alzheimer's disease, Depression, and Parkinson's disease show competitive results, highlighting the effectiveness of our method in pathological speech analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Datasets can be bolstered through data augmentation. However, even when utilizing a full suite of transformations during model training, typical data augmentations do not address variations in human anatomy. An alternative direction is to synthesize data using generative models, which can potentially craft datasets with specific attributes. While this holds promise, commonly used generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks may inadvertently produce anatomically inaccurate features. On the other hand, diffusion models, which offer greater stability, tend to memorize training data, raising concerns about privacy and generative diversity. Alternatively, inpainting has the potential to augment data through directly inserting pathology in medical images. However, this approach introduces a new challenge: accurately merging the generated pathological features with the surrounding anatomical context. While inpainting is a well established method for addressing simple lesions, its application to pathologies that involve complex structural changes remains relatively unexplored. We propose an efficient method for inpainting pathological features onto healthy anatomy in MRI through voxelwise noise scheduling in a latent diffusion model. We evaluate the method's ability to insert disc herniation and central canal stenosis in lumbar spine sagittal T2 MRI, and it achieves superior Frechet Inception Distance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Recently, pathological artificial intelligence (PAI) is thought to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, the high performance of PAI based on deep learning in the laboratory generally cannot be reproduced in the clinic. [Methods] Because the data preparation is important for PAI, the paper has reviewed PAI-related studies in the PubMed database published from January 2017 to February 2022, and 118 studies were included. The in-depth analysis of methods for preparing data is performed, including obtaining slides of pathological tissue, cleaning, screening, and then digitizing. Expert review, image annotation, dataset division for model training and validation are also discussed. We further discuss the reasons why the high performance of PAI is not reproducible in the clinical practices and show some effective ways to improve clinical performances of PAI. [Results] The robustness of PAI depend on randomized collection of representative disease slides, including rigorous quality control and screening, correction of digital discrepancies, reasonable annotation, and the amount of data. The digital pathology is fundamental of clinical-grade PAI, and the techniques of data standardization and weakly supervised learning methods based on whole slide image (WSI) are effective ways to overcome obstacles of performance reproduction. [Conclusion] The representative data, the amount of labeling and consistency from multi-centers is the key to performance reproduction. The digital pathology for clinical diagnosis, data standardization and technique of WSI-based weakly supervised learning hopefully build clinical-grade PAI.

Low-rank/Sparse (LRS) decomposition removes pathologies prior to registration; however, LRS is memory-demanding and slow, which limits its use on larger data sets. Additionally, LRS blurs normal tissue regions, which may degrade registration performance.

Modern end-to-end models require thousands of hours of data to train well, but only a small number of pathological speech datasets are publicly available. A proven solution to this problem is by first pretraining the model on a huge number of healthy speech datasets and then fine-tuning it on the pathological speech datasets. One new pretraining framework called self-supervised learning (SSL) trains a network using only speech data, providing more flexibility in training data requirements and allowing more speech data to be used in pretraining. We investigate SSL frameworks such as the wav2vec 2.0 and WavLM models using different setups and compare their performance with different supervised pretraining setups, using two types of pathological speech, namely, Japanese electrolaryngeal and English dysarthric. Our results show that although SSL has shown success with minimally resourced healthy speech, we do not find this to be the case with pathological speech. The best supervised setup outperforms the best SSL setup by 13.9% character error rate in electrolaryngeal speech and 16.8% word error rate in dysarthric speech.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2022</p></details> |
| **[Selfsupervised learning for pathological speech detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02572v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech production is a complex phenomenon, wherein the brain orchestrates a sequence of processes involving thought processing, motor planning, and the execution of articulatory movements. However, this intricate execution of various processes is susceptible to influence and disruption by various neurodegenerative pathological speech disorders, such as Parkinsons' disease, resulting in dysarthria, apraxia, and other conditions. These disorders lead to pathological speech characterized by abnormal speech patterns and imprecise articulation. Diagnosing these speech disorders in clinical settings typically involves auditory perceptual tests, which are time-consuming, and the diagnosis can vary among clinicians based on their experiences, biases, and cognitive load during the diagnosis. Additionally, unlike neurotypical speakers, patients with speech pathologies or impairments are unable to access various virtual assistants such as Alexa, Siri, etc. To address these challenges, several automatic pathological speech detection (PSD) approaches have been proposed. These approaches aim to provide efficient and accurate detection of speech disorders, thereby facilitating timely intervention and support for individuals affected by these conditions. These approaches mainly vary in two aspects: the input representations utilized and the classifiers employed. Due to the limited availability of data, the performance of detection remains subpar. Self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings, such as wav2vec2, and their multilingual versions, are being explored as a promising avenue to improve performance. These embeddings leverage self-supervised learning techniques to extract rich representations from audio data, thereby offering a potential solution to address the limitations posed by the scarcity of labeled data.</p></details> | <details><summary>in In...</summary><p>in Intersection of Book Chapter in Machine Leanring and Computational Social Sciences CRC (in progress) 2024</p></details> |

Yet pathological image datasets often lack biomedical text annotation and enrichment. Guiding data-efficient image diagnosis from the use of biomedical text knowledge becomes a substantial interest. In this paper, we propose to Connect Image and Text Embeddings (CITE) to enhance pathological image classification. CITE injects text insights gained from language models pre-trained with a broad range of biomedical texts, leading to adapt foundation models towards pathological image understanding. Through extensive experiments on the PatchGastric stomach tumor pathological image dataset, we demonstrate that CITE achieves leading performance compared with various baselines especially when training data is scarce. CITE offers insights into leveraging in-domain text knowledge to reinforce data-efficient pathological image classification.

| **[Suppressing Noise Disparity in Training Data for Automatic Pathological Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01209v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although automatic pathological speech detection approaches show promising results when clean recordings are available, they are vulnerable to additive noise. Recently it has been shown that databases commonly used to develop and evaluate such approaches are noisy, with the noise characteristics between healthy and pathological recordings being different. Consequently, automatic approaches trained on these databases often learn to discriminate noise rather than speech pathology. This paper introduces a method to mitigate this noise disparity in training data. Using noise estimates from recordings from one group of speakers to augment recordings from the other group, the noise characteristics become consistent across all recordings. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in mitigating noise disparity in training data, thereby enabling automatic pathological speech detection to focus on pathology-discriminant cues rather than noise-discriminant ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IWAENC 2024</p></details> |

Standard compression methods, such as JPEG, reduce file sizes but often fail to preserve fine-grained phenotypic details critical for downstream tasks. In this work, we repurpose autoencoders (AEs) designed for Latent Diffusion Models as an efficient learned compression framework for pathology images. We systematically benchmark three AE models with varying compression levels and evaluate their reconstruction ability using pathology foundation models. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy to further enhance reconstruction fidelity that optimizes a pathology-specific learned perceptual metric. We validate our approach on downstream tasks, including segmentation, patch classification, and multiple instance learning, showing that replacing images with AE-compressed reconstructions leads to minimal performance degradation. Additionally, we propose a K-means clustering-based quantization method for AE latents, improving storage efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality. We provide the weights of the fine-tuned autoencoders at https://huggingface.co/collections/StonyBrook-CVLab/pathology-fine-tuned-aes-67d45f223a659ff2e3402dd0.</p></details> |  |

Such applications will depend on models' abilities to capture the diverse patterns observed in pathology images. To address this challenge, we present Virchow, a foundation model for computational pathology. Using self-supervised learning empowered by the DINOv2 algorithm, Virchow is a vision transformer model with 632 million parameters trained on 1.5 million hematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images from diverse tissue and specimen types, which is orders of magnitude more data than previous works. The Virchow model enables the development of a pan-cancer detection system with 0.949 overall specimen-level AUC across 17 different cancer types, while also achieving 0.937 AUC on 7 rare cancer types. The Virchow model sets the state-of-the-art on the internal and external image tile level benchmarks and slide level biomarker prediction tasks. The gains in performance highlight the importance of training on massive pathology image datasets, suggesting scaling up the data and network architecture can improve the accuracy for many high-impact computational pathology applications where limited amounts of training data are available.</p></details> |  |

Staging of lung cancer is a major factor of prognosis. Measuring the maximum dimensions of the invasive component in a pathology images is an essential task. Therefore, image segmentation methods for visualizing the extent of invasive and noninvasive components on pathology images could support pathological examination. However, it is challenging for most of the recent segmentation methods that rely on supervised learning to cope with unlabeled pathology images. In this paper, we propose a unified approach to unsupervised representation learning and clustering for pathology image segmentation. Our method consists of two phases. In the first phase, we learn feature representations of training patches from a target image using the spherical k-means. The purpose of this phase is to obtain cluster centroids which could be used as filters for feature extraction. In the second phase, we apply conventional k-means to the representations extracted by the centroids and then project cluster labels to the target images. We evaluated our methods on pathology images of lung cancer specimen. Our experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms traditional k-means segmentation and the multithreshold Otsu method both quantitatively and qualitatively with an improved normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 0.626 compared to 0.168 and 0.167, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the centroids can be applied to the segmentation of other slices from the same sample.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at SPIE Medical Imaging 2018, Houston, TX, USA</p></details> |
| **[Quantitative Benchmarking of Anomaly Detection Methods in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19234v1)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images, such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over 20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for digital pathology images.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce GaitMotion, a multitask dataset leveraging wearable sensors to capture the patients' real-time movement with pathological gait. This dataset offers extensive ground-truth labeling for multiple tasks, including step/stride segmentation and step/stride length prediction, empowers researchers with a more holistic understanding of gait disturbances linked to neurological impairments. The wearable gait analysis suit captures the gait cycle, pattern, and parameters for both normal and pathological subjects. This data may prove beneficial for healthcare products focused on patient progress monitoring and post-disease recovery, as well as for forensics technologies aimed at person reidentification, and biomechanics research to aid in the development of humanoid robotics. Moreover, the analysis has considered the drift in data distribution across individual subjects. This drift can be attributed to each participant's unique behavioral habits or potential displacement of the sensor. Stride length variance for normal, Parkinson's, and stroke patients are compared to recognize the pathological walking pattern. As the baseline and benchmark, we provide an error of 14.1, 13.3, and 12.2 centimeters of stride length prediction for normal, Parkinson's, and Stroke gaits separately. We also analyzed the gait characteristics for normal and pathological gaits in terms of the gait cycle and gait parameters.</p></details> |  |

These representations may contain pathology irrelevant uncorrelated information, such as changing phonetic content or variations in speaking style across time, which can adversely affect classification performance. To address this issue, we propose to use Multiview Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA) on these input representations prior to automatic pathological speech detection. Our results demonstrate that unlike other dimensionality reduction techniques, the use of MCCA leads to a considerable improvement in pathological speech detection performance by eliminating uncorrelated information present in the input representations. Employing MCCA with traditional classifiers yields a comparable or higher performance than using sophisticated architectures, while preserving the representation structure and providing interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17734v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViCTr: Vital Consistency Transfer for Pathology Aware Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04963v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing medical images remains challenging due to limited annotated pathological data, modality domain gaps, and the complexity of representing diffuse pathologies such as liver cirrhosis. Existing methods often struggle to maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features, frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Multitask Representation Learning for Pathology Biobank Metadata Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07846v1)** | 2019-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[Patho-R1: A Multimodal Reinforcement Learning-Based Pathology Expert Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11404v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists. In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we propose Patho-CLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both Patho-CLIP and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project is available at the Patho-R1 repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-R1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis and Detection of Pathological Voice using Glottal Source Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14080v2)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic detection of voice pathology enables objective assessment and earlier intervention for the diagnosis. This study provides a systematic analysis of glottal source features and investigates their effectiveness in voice pathology detection. Glottal source features are extracted using glottal flows estimated with the quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering method, using approximate glottal source signals computed with the zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method, and using acoustic voice signals directly. In addition, we propose to derive mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from the glottal source waveforms computed by QCP and ZFF to effectively capture the variations in glottal source spectra of pathological voice. Experiments were carried out using two databases, the Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias (HUPA) database and the Saarbrucken Voice Disorders (SVD) database. Analysis of features revealed that the glottal source contains information that discriminates normal and pathological voice. Pathology detection experiments were carried out using support vector machine (SVM). From the detection experiments it was observed that the performance achieved with the studied glottal source features is comparable or better than that of conventional MFCCs and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features. The best detection performance was achieved when the glottal source features were combined with the conventional MFCCs and PLP features, which indicates the complementary nature of the features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2020 IEEE.

These methods face sustainability challenges due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches involve fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and texts separately, limiting their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate pathology universal embeddings to address these challenges. Our contributions can be summarized in the following aspects: 1) We propose MLLM4PUE, a novel framework that leverages MLLMs to generate embeddings for various pathology downstream tasks. 2) We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of pathology multimodal embeddings, which comprises 16 original tasks drawn from 15 datasets. 3) Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MLLM4PUE, illustrating MLLM-based models can effectively support a wide range of downstream tasks and unify the research direction for foundation models in pathology.</p></details> |  |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p></details> |  |

However, the field of pathology has largely remained untapped, particularly in gathering high-quality data and designing comprehensive model frameworks. To bridge the gap in pathology MLLMs, we present PathAsst, a multimodal generative foundation AI assistant to revolutionize diagnostic and predictive analytics in pathology. The development of PathAsst involves three pivotal steps: data acquisition, CLIP model adaptation, and the training of PathAsst's multimodal generative capabilities. Firstly, we collect over 207K high-quality pathology image-text pairs from authoritative sources. Leveraging the advanced power of ChatGPT, we generate over 180K instruction-following samples. Furthermore, we devise additional instruction-following data specifically tailored for invoking eight pathology-specific sub-models we prepared, allowing the PathAsst to effectively collaborate with these models, enhancing its diagnostic ability. Secondly, by leveraging the collected data, we construct PathCLIP, a pathology-dedicated CLIP, to enhance PathAsst's capabilities in interpreting pathology images. Finally, we integrate PathCLIP with the Vicuna-13b and utilize pathology-specific instruction-tuning data to enhance the multimodal generation capacity of PathAsst and bolster its synergistic interactions with sub-models. The experimental results of PathAsst show the potential of harnessing AI-powered generative foundation model to improve pathology diagnosis and treatment processes.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Prior work often relies on domain fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3 dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks, YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of 23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.</p></details> |  |

Entity-graphs offer flexible and scalable representations to characterize tissue organization, while allowing the incorporation of prior pathological knowledge to further support model interpretability and explainability. However, entity-graph analysis requires prerequisites for image-to-graph translation and knowledge of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms applied to graph-structured data, which can potentially hinder their adoption. In this work, we aim to alleviate these issues by developing HistoCartography, a standardized python API with necessary preprocessing, machine learning and explainability tools to facilitate graph-analytics in computational pathology. Further, we have benchmarked the computational time and performance on multiple datasets across different imaging types and histopathology tasks to highlight the applicability of the API for building computational pathology workflows.</p></details> |  |

Notably, several models trained on large quantities of clinical data have been made publicly available in recent months. This will significantly enhance scientific research in computational pathology and help bridge the gap between research and clinical deployment. With the increase in availability of public foundation models of different sizes, trained using different algorithms on different datasets, it becomes important to establish a benchmark to compare the performance of such models on a variety of clinically relevant tasks spanning multiple organs and diseases. In this work, we present a collection of pathology datasets comprising clinical slides associated with clinically relevant endpoints including cancer diagnoses and a variety of biomarkers generated during standard hospital operation from two medical centers. We leverage these datasets to systematically assess the performance of public pathology foundation models and provide insights into best practices for training new foundation models and selecting appropriate pretrained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.07033</p></details> |

Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEW: Self-calibration Enhanced Whole Slide Pathology Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10853v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology images are considered the ``gold standard" for cancer diagnosis and treatment, with gigapixel images providing extensive tissue and cellular information. Existing methods fail to simultaneously extract global structural and local detail features for comprehensive pathology image analysis efficiently. To address these limitations, we propose a self-calibration enhanced framework for whole slide pathology image analysis, comprising three components: a global branch, a focus predictor, and a detailed branch. The global branch initially classifies using the pathological thumbnail, while the focus predictor identifies relevant regions for classification based on the last layer features of the global branch. The detailed extraction branch then assesses whether the magnified regions correspond to the lesion area. Finally, a feature consistency constraint between the global and detail branches ensures that the global branch focuses on the appropriate region and extracts sufficient discriminative features for final identification. These focused discriminative features prove invaluable for uncovering novel prognostic tumor markers from the perspective of feature cluster uniqueness and tissue spatial distribution. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed framework can rapidly deliver accurate and explainable results for pathological grading and prognosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Whole Pathological Slide Classification via Weakly Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.06344v1)** | 2023-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to its superior efficiency in utilizing annotations and addressing gigapixel-sized images, multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown great promise as a framework for whole slide image (WSI) classification in digital pathology diagnosis. However, existing methods tend to focus on advanced aggregators with different structures, often overlooking the intrinsic features of H\&E pathological slides. To address this limitation, we introduced two pathological priors: nuclear heterogeneity of diseased cells and spatial correlation of pathological tiles. Leveraging the former, we proposed a data augmentation method that utilizes stain separation during extractor training via a contrastive learning strategy to obtain instance-level representations. We then described the spatial relationships between the tiles using an adjacency matrix. By integrating these two views, we designed a multi-instance framework for analyzing H\&E-stained tissue images based on pathological inductive bias, encompassing feature extraction, filtering, and aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Camelyon16 breast dataset and TCGA-NSCLC Lung dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework can effectively handle tasks related to cancer detection and differentiation of subtypes, outperforming state-of-the-art medical image classification methods based on MIL. The code will be released later.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLUTO-4: Frontier Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02826v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks. Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer (PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains. Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying spatial and biological context, including tile classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks, including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learned Image Compression and Restoration for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23862v2)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology images play a crucial role in medical diagnostics, but their ultra-high resolution and large file sizes pose significant challenges for storage, transmission, and real-time visualization. To address these issues, we propose CLERIC, a novel deep learning-based image compression framework designed specifically for whole slide images (WSIs). CLERIC integrates a learnable lifting scheme and advanced convolutional techniques to enhance compression efficiency while preserving critical pathological details. Our framework employs a lifting-scheme transform in the analysis stage to decompose images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling more structured latent representations. These components are processed through parallel encoders incorporating Deformable Residual Blocks (DRB) and Recurrent Residual Blocks (R2B) to improve feature extraction and spatial adaptability. The synthesis stage applies an inverse lifting transform for effective image reconstruction, ensuring high-fidelity restoration of fine-grained tissue structures. We evaluate CLERIC on a digital pathology image dataset and compare its performance against state-of-the-art learned image compression (LIC) models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLERIC achieves superior rate-distortion (RD) performance, significantly reducing storage requirements while maintaining high diagnostic image quality. Our study highlights the potential of deep learning-based compression in digital pathology, facilitating efficient data management and long-term storage while ensuring seamless integration into clinical workflows and AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

| **[Comparative Analysis of Diffusion Generative Models in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15719v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Generative Models (DGM) have rapidly surfaced as emerging topics in the field of computer vision, garnering significant interest across a wide array of deep learning applications. Despite their high computational demand, these models are extensively utilized for their superior sample quality and robust mode coverage. While research in diffusion generative models is advancing, exploration within the domain of computational pathology and its large-scale datasets has been comparatively gradual. Bridging the gap between the high-quality generation capabilities of Diffusion Generative Models and the intricate nature of pathology data, this paper presents an in-depth comparative analysis of diffusion methods applied to a pathology dataset. Our analysis extends to datasets with varying Fields of View (FOV), revealing that DGMs are highly effective in producing high-quality synthetic data. An ablative study is also conducted, followed by a detailed discussion on the impact of various methods on the synthesized histopathology images. One striking observation from our experiments is how the adjustment of image size during data generation can simulate varying fields of view. These findings underscore the potential of DGMs to enhance the quality and diversity of synthetic pathology data, especially when used with real data, ultimately increasing accuracy of deep learning models in histopathology.

| **[A Foundational Multimodal Vision Language AI Assistant for Human Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.07814v1)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has witnessed remarkable progress in the development of both task-specific predictive models and task-agnostic self-supervised vision encoders. However, despite the explosive growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI), there has been limited study on building general purpose, multimodal AI assistants tailored to pathology. Here we present PathChat, a vision-language generalist AI assistant for human pathology using an in-house developed foundational vision encoder pretrained on 100 million histology images from over 100,000 patient cases and 1.18 million pathology image-caption pairs. The vision encoder is then combined with a pretrained large language model and the whole system is finetuned on over 250,000 diverse disease agnostic visual language instructions. We compare PathChat against several multimodal vision language AI assistants as well as GPT4V, which powers the commercially available multimodal general purpose AI assistant ChatGPT-4. When relevant clinical context is provided with the histology image, PathChat achieved a diagnostic accuracy of 87% on multiple-choice questions based on publicly available cases of diverse tissue origins and disease models. Additionally, using open-ended questions and human expert evaluation, we found that overall PathChat produced more accurate and pathologist-preferable responses to diverse queries related to pathology. As an interactive and general vision language AI assistant that can flexibly handle both visual and natural language inputs, PathChat can potentially find impactful applications in pathology education, research, and human-in-the-loop clinical decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathological Cases for a Class of Reachability-Based Garbage Collectors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11654v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing garbage collectors (GCs) perform extremely well on typical programs, there still exist pathological programs for which modern GCs significantly degrade performance. This observation begs the question: might there exist a 'holy grail' GC algorithm, as yet undiscovered, guaranteeing both constant-length pause times and that memory is collected promptly upon becoming unreachable? For decades, researchers have understood that such a GC is not always possible, i.e., some pathological behavior is unavoidable when the program can make heap cycles and operates near the memory limit, regardless of the GC algorithm used. However, this understanding has until now been only informal, lacking a rigorous formal proof. This paper complements that informal understanding with a rigorous proof, showing with mathematical certainty that every GC that can implement a realistic mutator-observer interface has some pathological program that forces it to either introduce a long GC pause into program execution or reject an allocation even though there is available space. Hence, language designers must either accept these pathological scenarios and design heuristic approaches that minimize their impact (e.g., generational collection), or restrict programs and environments to a strict subset of the behaviors allowed by our mutator-observer-style interface (e.g., by enforcing a type system that disallows cycles or overprovisioning memory).</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[REET: Robustness Evaluation and Enhancement Toolbox for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12311v1)** | 2022-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation: Digitization of pathology laboratories through digital slide scanners and advances in deep learning approaches for objective histological assessment have resulted in rapid progress in the field of computational pathology (CPath) with wide-ranging applications in medical and pharmaceutical research as well as clinical workflows. However, the estimation of robustness of CPath models to variations in input images is an open problem with a significant impact on the down-stream practical applicability, deployment and acceptability of these approaches. Furthermore, development of domain-specific strategies for enhancement of robustness of such models is of prime importance as well. Implementation and Availability: In this work, we propose the first domain-specific Robustness Evaluation and Enhancement Toolbox (REET) for computational pathology applications. It provides a suite of algorithmic strategies for enabling robustness assessment of predictive models with respect to specialized image transformations such as staining, compression, focusing, blurring, changes in spatial resolution, brightness variations, geometric changes as well as pixel-level adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, REET also enables efficient and robust training of deep learning pipelines in computational pathology.

Instead of using healthy speech as a source, we customise an existing pathological speech sample to a new speaker's voice characteristics. This approach alleviates the evaluation problem one normally has when converting typical speech to pathological speech, as in our approach, the voice conversion (VC) model does not need to be optimised for speech degradation but only for the speaker change. This change in the optimisation ensures that any degradation found in naturalness is due to the conversion process and not due to the model exaggerating characteristics of a speech pathology. To show a proof of concept of this method, we convert dysarthric speech using the UASpeech database and an autoencoder-based VC technique. Subjective evaluation results show reasonable naturalness for high intelligibility dysarthric speakers, though lower intelligibility seems to introduce a marginal degradation in naturalness scores for mid and low intelligibility speakers compared to ground truth. Conversion of speaker characteristics for low and high intelligibility speakers is successful, but not for mid. Whether the differences in the results for the different intelligibility levels is due to the intelligibility levels or due to the speakers needs to be further investigated.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures.

| **[SPLICE -- Streamlining Digital Pathology Image Processing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17704v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) models have revolutionized histopathology, opening new opportunities. With the increasing availability of Whole Slide Images (WSIs), there's a growing demand for efficient retrieval, processing, and analysis of relevant images from vast biomedical archives. However, processing WSIs presents challenges due to their large size and content complexity. Full computer digestion of WSIs is impractical, and processing all patches individually is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised patching algorithm, Sequential Patching Lattice for Image Classification and Enquiry (SPLICE). This novel approach condenses a histopathology WSI into a compact set of representative patches, forming a "collage" of WSI while minimizing redundancy. SPLICE prioritizes patch quality and uniqueness by sequentially analyzing a WSI and selecting non-redundant representative features. We evaluated SPLICE for search and match applications, demonstrating improved accuracy, reduced computation time, and storage requirements compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. As an unsupervised method, SPLICE effectively reduces storage requirements for representing tissue images by 50%. This reduction enables numerous algorithms in computational pathology to operate much more efficiently, paving the way for accelerated adoption of digital pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for publication</p></details> |
| **[Current Pathology Foundation Models are unrobust to Medical Center Differences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18055v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim of advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable pathology FMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aging display's effect on interpretation of digital pathology slides](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.09166v1)** | 2015-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is our conjecture that the variability of colors in a pathology image effects the interpretation of pathology cases, whether it is diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence, or workflow efficiency. In this paper, digital pathology images are analyzed to quantify the perceived difference in color that occurs due to display aging, in particular a change in the maximum luminance, white point, and color gamut. The digital pathology images studied include diagnostically important features, such as the conspicuity of nuclei. Three different display aging models are applied to images: aging of luminance & chrominance, aging of chrominance only, and a stabilized luminance & chrominance (i.e., no aging). These display models and images are then used to compare conspicuity of nuclei using CIE deltaE2000, a perceptual color difference metric. The effect of display aging using these display models and images is further analyzed through a human reader study designed to quantify the effects from a clinical perspective. Results from our reader study indicate significant impact of aged displays on workflow as well as diagnosis as follow. As compared to the originals (no-aging), slides with the effect of aging simulated were significantly more difficult to read (p-value of 0.0005) and took longer to score (p-value of 0.02). Moreover, luminance+chrominance aging significantly reduced inter-session percent agreement of diagnostic scores (p-value of 0.0418).</p></details> |  |
| **[Hibou: A Family of Foundational Vision Transformers for Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05074v2)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology, the microscopic examination of diseased tissue, is critical for diagnosing various medical conditions, particularly cancers. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data. This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, Hibou-L achieves the highest average accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. To support further research and application in the field, we have open-sourced the Hibou models, which can be accessed at https://github.com/HistAI/hibou.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of lung cancer subtypes on CT images with synthetic pathological priors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.04663v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accurate diagnosis on pathological subtypes for lung cancer is of significant importance for the follow-up treatments and prognosis managements. In this paper, we propose self-generating hybrid feature network (SGHF-Net) for accurately classifying lung cancer subtypes on computed tomography (CT) images. Inspired by studies stating that cross-scale associations exist in the image patterns between the same case's CT images and its pathological images, we innovatively developed a pathological feature synthetic module (PFSM), which quantitatively maps cross-modality associations through deep neural networks, to derive the "gold standard" information contained in the corresponding pathological images from CT images. Additionally, we designed a radiological feature extraction module (RFEM) to directly acquire CT image information and integrated it with the pathological priors under an effective feature fusion framework, enabling the entire classification model to generate more indicative and specific pathologically related features and eventually output more accurate predictions. The superiority of the proposed model lies in its ability to self-generate hybrid features that contain multi-modality image information based on a single-modality input. To evaluate the effectiveness, adaptability, and generalization ability of our model, we performed extensive experiments on a large-scale multi-center dataset (i.e., 829 cases from three hospitals) to compare our model and a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification models. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our model for lung cancer subtypes classification with significant accuracy improvements in terms of accuracy (ACC), area under the curve (AUC), and F1 score.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

However, the usage of deep learning networks for the pathological image analysis encounters several challenges, e.g. high resolution (gigapixel) of pathological images and lack of annotations of cancer areas. To address the challenges, we proposed a complete framework for the pathological image classification, which consists of a novel training strategy, namely reversed active learning (RAL), and an advanced network, namely atrous DenseNet (ADN). The proposed RAL can remove the mislabel patches in the training set. The refined training set can then be used to train widely used deep learning networks, e.g. VGG-16, ResNets, etc. A novel deep learning network, i.e. atrous DenseNet (ADN), is also proposed for the classification of pathological images. The proposed ADN achieves multi-scale feature extraction by integrating the atrous convolutions to the Dense Block. The proposed RAL and ADN have been evaluated on two pathological datasets, i.e. BACH and CCG. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed ADN + RAL framework, i.e. the average patch-level ACAs of 94.10% and 92.05% on BACH and CCG validation sets were achieved.</p></details> |  |

Despite its significance, most researchers in this field primarily focus on the registration of normal tissue into normal tissue. The negative impact of focal tissue, such as the loss of spatial correspondence information and the abnormal distortion of tissue, are rarely considered. In this paper, we propose GIRNet, a novel unsupervised approach for pathological image registration by incorporating segmentation and inpainting through the principles of Generation, Inpainting, and Registration (GIR). The registration, segmentation, and inpainting modules are trained simultaneously in a co-learning manner so that the segmentation of the focal area and the registration of inpainted pairs can improve collaboratively. Overall, the registration of pathological images is achieved in a completely unsupervised learning framework. Experimental results on multiple datasets, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of T1 sequences, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our results show that our method can accurately achieve the registration of pathological images and identify lesions even in challenging imaging modalities. Our unsupervised approach offers a promising solution for the efficient and cost-effective registration of pathological images.

Local descriptor-based classification methods have shown to work well in annotating pathologies; however, these methods are usually computationally intensive which restricts their widespread use in real-time or near-real-time clinical applications. In this paper, we present a novel approach for fast, accurate, reliable segmentation of pathological lungs from CT scans by combining region-based segmentation method with local descriptor classification that is performed on an optimized sampling grid. Our method works in two stages; during stage one, we adapted the fuzzy connectedness (FC) image segmentation algorithm to perform initial lung parenchyma extraction. In the second stage, texture-based local descriptors are utilized to segment abnormal imaging patterns using a near optimal keypoint analysis by employing centroid of supervoxel as grid points. The quantitative results show that our pathological lung segmentation method is fast, robust, and improves on current standards and has potential to enhance the performance of routine clinical tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 5 figures; to appear in the proceedings of 36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC 2014)</p></details> |

However, echocardiographic data for certain pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies. Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator, allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity. Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers. Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively.

To theoretically elucidate the effectiveness of normalization, we quantify the geometry of the parameter space determined by the Fisher information matrix (FIM), which also corresponds to the local shape of the loss landscape under certain conditions. We analyze deep neural networks with random initialization, which is known to suffer from a pathologically sharp shape of the landscape when the network becomes sufficiently wide. We reveal that batch normalization in the last layer contributes to drastically decreasing such pathological sharpness if the width and sample number satisfy a specific condition. In contrast, it is hard for batch normalization in the middle hidden layers to alleviate pathological sharpness in many settings. We also found that layer normalization cannot alleviate pathological sharpness either. Thus, we can conclude that batch normalization in the last layer significantly contributes to decreasing the sharpness induced by the FIM.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2019</p></details> |

| **[Anatomy-Guided Radiology Report Generation with Pathology-Aware Regional Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10789v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to enhance radiology practice.</p></details> |  |

While current digital pathology solutions rely on lossy JPEG compression to address this issue, lossy compression can introduce color and texture disparities, potentially impacting clinical decision-making. While prior research addresses perceptual image quality and downstream performance independently of each other, we jointly evaluate compression schemes for perceptual and downstream task quality on four different datasets. In addition, we collect an initially uncompressed dataset for an unbiased perceptual evaluation of compression schemes. Our results show that deep learning models fine-tuned for perceptual quality outperform conventional compression schemes like JPEG-XL or WebP for further compression of WSI. However, they exhibit a significant bias towards the compression artifacts present in the training data and struggle to generalize across various compression schemes. We introduce a novel evaluation metric based on feature similarity between original files and compressed files that aligns very well with the actual downstream performance on the compressed WSI. Our metric allows for a general and standardized evaluation of lossy compression schemes and mitigates the requirement to independently assess different downstream tasks. Our study provides novel insights for the assessment of lossy compression schemes for WSI and encourages a unified evaluation of lossy compression schemes to accelerate the clinical uptake of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Pathology Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09521v3)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy in pathology image analysis. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490K samples from diverse pathology tasks, we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

Using two recently collected Dutch datasets with parallel pre and post-surgery audio from the same speaker, NKI-OC-VC and SPOKE, we assess the extent to which speech pathology influences ASV performance, and whether objective/subjective measures of speech severity are correlated with the performance. Finally, we carry out a perceptual study to compare judgements of ASV and human listeners. Our findings reveal that pathological speech negatively affects ASV performance, and the severity of the speech is negatively correlated with the performance. There is a moderate agreement in perceptual and objective scores of speaker similarity and severity, however, we could not clearly establish in the perceptual study, whether the same phenomenon also exists in human perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Risk prediction of pathological gambling on social media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19358v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of risk prediction on social media data, specifically focusing on the classification of Reddit users as having a pathological gambling disorder. To tackle this problem, this paper focuses on incorporating temporal and emotional features into the model. The preprocessing phase involves dealing with the time irregularity of posts by padding sequences. Two baseline architectures are used for preliminary evaluation: BERT classifier on concatenated posts per user and GRU with LSTM on sequential data. Experimental results demonstrate that the sequential models outperform the concatenation-based model. The results of the experiments conclude that the incorporation of a time decay layer (TD) and passing the emotion classification layer (EmoBERTa) through LSTM improves the performance significantly. Experiments concluded that the addition of a self-attention layer didn't significantly improve the performance of the model, however provided easily interpretable attention scores. The developed architecture with the inclusion of EmoBERTa and TD layers achieved a high F1 score, beating existing benchmarks on pathological gambling dataset. Future work may involve the early prediction of risk factors associated with pathological gambling disorder and testing models on other datasets. Overall, this research highlights the significance of the sequential processing of posts including temporal and emotional features to boost the predictive power, as well as adding an attention layer for interpretability.</p></details> |  |

The paper improves on previous two-stage approach to H2P-VC where (1) speech is created first with the appropriate severity, (2) then the speaker identity of the voice is converted while preserving the severity of the voice. Specifically, we propose improvements to (2) by using phonetic posteriorgrams (PPG) and global style tokens (GST). Furthermore, we present a new dataset that contains parallel recordings of pathological and healthy speakers with the same identity which allows more precise evaluation. Listening tests by expert listeners show that the framework preserves severity of the source sample, while modelling target speaker's voice. We also show that (a) pathology impacts x-vectors but not all speaker information is lost, (b) choosing source speakers based on severity labels alone is insufficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables.

To overcome data-scarcity in computational pathology, recent studies exploit transfer learning to reuse knowledge gained from natural images in pathology image analysis, aiming to build effective pathology image diagnosis models. Since transferability of knowledge heavily depends on the similarity of the original and target tasks, significant differences in image content and statistics between pathology images and natural images raise the questions: how much knowledge is transferable? Is the transferred information equally contributed by pre-trained layers? To answer these questions, this paper proposes a framework to quantify knowledge gain by a particular layer, conducts an empirical investigation in pathology image centered transfer learning, and reports some interesting observations. Particularly, compared to the performance baseline obtained by random-weight model, though transferability of off-the-shelf representations from deep layers heavily depend on specific pathology image sets, the general representation generated by early layers does convey transferred knowledge in various image classification applications. The observation in this study encourages further investigation of specific metric and tools to quantify effectiveness and feasibility of transfer learning in future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exper...</summary><p>Experimentation data correction</p></details> |

Since ST is closely related to pathological features such as disease subtypes, it may be valuable to augment image representation with pathological information. However, there are no attempts to leverage ST for image recognition ({\it i.e,} patch-level classification of subtypes of pathological image.). One of the big challenges is significant batch effects in spatial transcriptomics that make it difficult to extract pathological features of images from ST. In this paper, we propose a batch-agnostic contrastive learning framework that can extract consistent signals from gene expression of ST in multiple patients. To extract consistent signals from ST, we utilize the batch-agnostic gene encoder that is trained in a variational inference manner. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework on a publicly available dataset.

Generative AI "co-pilots" now demonstrate the ability to mine subtle, sub-visual tissue cues across the cellular-to-pathology spectrum, generate comprehensive reports, and respond to complex user queries. The scale of data has surged dramatically, growing from tens to millions of multi-gigapixel tissue images, while the number of trainable parameters in these models has risen to several billion. The critical question remains: how will this new wave of generative and multi-purpose AI transform clinical diagnostics? In this article, we explore the true potential of these innovations and their integration into clinical practice. We review the rapid progress of foundation models in pathology, clarify their applications and significance. More precisely, we examine the very definition of foundational models, identifying what makes them foundational, general, or multipurpose, and assess their impact on computational pathology. Additionally, we address the unique challenges associated with their development and evaluation. These models have demonstrated exceptional predictive and generative capabilities, but establishing global benchmarks is crucial to enhancing evaluation standards and fostering their widespread clinical adoption. In computational pathology, the broader impact of frontier AI ultimately depends on widespread adoption and societal acceptance. While direct public exposure is not strictly necessary, it remains a powerful tool for dispelling misconceptions, building trust, and securing regulatory support.</p></details> | 63 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A Hybrid Deep Feature-Based Deformable Image Registration Method for Pathology Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07655v4)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists need to combine information from differently stained pathology slices for accurate diagnosis. Deformable image registration is a necessary technique for fusing multi-modal pathology slices. This paper proposes a hybrid deep feature-based deformable image registration framework for stained pathology samples. We first extract dense feature points via the detector-based and detector-free deep learning feature networks and perform points matching. Then, to further reduce false matches, an outlier detection method combining the isolation forest statistical model and the local affine correction model is proposed. Finally, the interpolation method generates the deformable vector field for pathology image registration based on the above matching points. We evaluate our method on the dataset of the Non-rigid Histology Image Registration (ANHIR) challenge, which is co-organized with the IEEE ISBI 2019 conference. Our technique outperforms the traditional approaches by 17% with the Average-Average registration target error (rTRE) reaching 0.0034. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance and ranked 1st in evaluating the test dataset. The proposed hybrid deep feature-based registration method can potentially become a reliable method for pathology image registration.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Training state-of-the-art pathology foundation models with orders of magnitude less data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05186v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has recently seen rapid advances driven by the development of modern vision foundation models (FMs), typically trained on vast collections of pathology images. Recent studies demonstrate that increasing the training data set and model size and integrating domain-specific image processing techniques can significantly enhance the model's performance on downstream tasks. Building on these insights, our work incorporates several recent modifications to the standard DINOv2 framework from the literature to optimize the training of pathology FMs. We also apply a post-training procedure for fine-tuning models on higher-resolution images to further enrich the information encoded in the embeddings. We present three novel pathology FMs trained on up to two orders of magnitude fewer WSIs than those used to train other state-of-the-art FMs while demonstrating a comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks. Even the model trained on TCGA alone (12k WSIs) outperforms most existing FMs and, on average, matches Virchow2, the second-best FM published to date. This suggests that there still remains a significant potential for further improving the models and algorithms used to train pathology FMs to take full advantage of the vast data collections.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Deep Biological Pathway Informed Pathology-Genomic Multimodal Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.02383v1)** | 2023-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of multi-modal data, such as pathological images and genomic data, is essential for understanding cancer heterogeneity and complexity for personalized treatments, as well as for enhancing survival predictions. Despite the progress made in integrating pathology and genomic data, most existing methods cannot mine the complex inter-modality relations thoroughly. Additionally, identifying explainable features from these models that govern preclinical discovery and clinical prediction is crucial for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response studies. We propose PONET- a novel biological pathway-informed pathology-genomic deep model that integrates pathological images and genomic data not only to improve survival prediction but also to identify genes and pathways that cause different survival rates in patients. Empirical results on six of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior predictive performance and reveals meaningful biological interpretations. The proposed method establishes insight into how to train biologically informed deep networks on multimodal biomedical data which will have general applicability for understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to treatment.</p></details> |  |

There are a variety of methods and models capable of identifying an individual based on their pattern of ambulatory locomotion. By surveying the current literature on gait recognition, this paper seeks to identify appropriate metrics, devices, and algorithms for collecting and analyzing data regarding patterns and modes of ambulatory movement across individuals. Furthermore, this survey seeks to motivate interest in a broader scope of longitudinal analysis regarding the perturbations in gait across states (i.e. physiological, emotive, and/or cognitive states). More broadly, inferences to normal versus pathological gait patterns can be attributed, based on both longitudinal and non-longitudinal forms of classification. This may indicate promising research directions and experimental designs, such as creating algorithmic metrics for the quantification of fatigue, or models for forecasting episodic disorders. Furthermore, in conjunction with other measurements of physiological and environmental conditions, pathological gait classification might be applicable to inference for syndromic surveillance of infectious disease states or cognitive impairment.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel weakly supervised method to localize chest pathologies using class aware deep multiscale feature learning. Our method leverages intermediate feature maps from CNN layers at different stages of a deep network during the training of a classification model using image level annotations of pathologies. During the training phase, a set of \emph{layer relevance weights} are learned for each pathology class and the CNN is optimized to perform pathology classification by convex combination of feature maps from both shallow and deep layers using the learned weights. During the test phase, to localize the predicted pathology, the multiscale attention map is obtained by convex combination of class activation maps from each stage using the \emph{layer relevance weights} learned during the training phase. We have validated our method using 112000 X-ray images and compared with the state-of-the-art localization methods. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed weakly supervised method can improve the localization performance of small pathologies such as nodule and mass while giving comparable performance for bigger pathologies e.g., Cardiomegaly</p></details> |  |

We explore three fusion strategies to combine sentence reading and sustained vowel recordings: waveform concatenation, intermediate feature fusion, and decision-level combination. Empirical validation across the German, Portuguese, and Italian languages shows that intermediate feature fusion using transformers best captures the complementary characteristics of both recording types.

Recent studies has demonstrated that the large vision-language model can enhance the performance of various downstream tasks in medical image understanding. In this study, we developed a domain-specific large language-vision assistant (PA-LLaVA) for pathology image understanding. Specifically, (1) we first construct a human pathology image-text dataset by cleaning the public medical image-text data for domain-specific alignment; (2) Using the proposed image-text data, we first train a pathology language-image pretraining (PLIP) model as the specialized visual encoder for pathology image, and then we developed scale-invariant connector to avoid the information loss caused by image scaling; (3) We adopt two-stage learning to train PA-LLaVA, first stage for domain alignment, and second stage for end to end visual question \& answering (VQA) task. In experiments, we evaluate our PA-LLaVA on both supervised and zero-shot VQA datasets, our model achieved the best overall performance among multimodal models of similar scale. The ablation experiments also confirmed the effectiveness of our design. We posit that our PA-LLaVA model and the datasets presented in this work can promote research in field of computational pathology.

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised CNN approach to leverage unlabeled data for learning generalizable and domain invariant representations in pathology images. The proposed approach, which we term as Self-Path, is a multi-task learning approach where the main task is tissue classification and pretext tasks are a variety of self-supervised tasks with labels inherent to the input data. We introduce novel domain specific self-supervision tasks that leverage contextual, multi-resolution and semantic features in pathology images for semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation. We investigate the effectiveness of Self-Path on 3 different pathology datasets. Our results show that Self-Path with the domain-specific pretext tasks achieves state-of-the-art performance for semi-supervised learning when small amounts of labeled data are available. Further, we show that Self-Path improves domain adaptation for classification of histology image patches when there is no labeled data available for the target domain. This approach can potentially be employed for other applications in computational pathology, where annotation budget is often limited or large amount of unlabeled image data is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10573v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 tables and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Large Multimodal Model based Standardisation of Pathology Reports with Confidence and their Prognostic Significance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02040v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology reports are rich in clinical and pathological details but are often presented in free-text format. The unstructured nature of these reports presents a significant challenge limiting the accessibility of their content. In this work, we present a practical approach based on the use of large multimodal models (LMMs) for automatically extracting information from scanned images of pathology reports with the goal of generating a standardised report specifying the value of different fields along with estimated confidence about the accuracy of the extracted fields. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods which do not assign confidence scores to extracted fields limiting their practical use. The proposed framework uses two stages of prompting a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for information extraction and validation. The framework generalises to textual reports from multiple medical centres as well as scanned images of legacy pathology reports. We show that the estimated confidence is an effective indicator of the accuracy of the extracted information that can be used to select only accurately extracted fields. We also show the prognostic significance of structured and unstructured data from pathology reports and show that the automatically extracted field values significant prognostic value for patient stratification. The framework is available for evaluation via the URL: https://labieb.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The effect of speech pathology on automatic speaker verification -- a large-scale study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06450v3)** | 2023-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating the challenges of data-driven speech processing, one of the primary hurdles is accessing reliable pathological speech data. While public datasets appear to offer solutions, they come with inherent risks of potential unintended exposure of patient health information via re-identification attacks. Using a comprehensive real-world pathological speech corpus, with over n=3,800 test subjects spanning various age groups and speech disorders, we employed a deep-learning-driven automatic speaker verification (ASV) approach. This resulted in a notable mean equal error rate (EER) of 0.89% with a standard deviation of 0.06%, outstripping traditional benchmarks. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate that pathological speech overall faces heightened privacy breach risks compared to healthy speech. Specifically, adults with dysphonia are at heightened re-identification risks, whereas conditions like dysarthria yield results comparable to those of healthy speakers. Crucially, speech intelligibility does not influence the ASV system's performance metrics. In pediatric cases, particularly those with cleft lip and palate, the recording environment plays a decisive role in re-identification. Merging data across pathological types led to a marked EER decrease, suggesting the potential benefits of pathological diversity in ASV, accompanied by a logarithmic boost in ASV effectiveness. In essence, this research sheds light on the dynamics between pathological speech and speaker verification, emphasizing its crucial role in safeguarding patient confidentiality in our increasingly digitized healthcare era.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Scientific Reports</p></details> |

Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[Machine-Learning-Based Diagnostics of EEG Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05115v1)** | 2021-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) methods have the potential to automate clinical EEG analysis. They can be categorized into feature-based (with handcrafted features), and end-to-end approaches (with learned features). Previous studies on EEG pathology decoding have typically analyzed a limited number of features, decoders, or both. For a I) more elaborate feature-based EEG analysis, and II) in-depth comparisons of both approaches, here we first develop a comprehensive feature-based framework, and then compare this framework to state-of-the-art end-to-end methods. To this aim, we apply the proposed feature-based framework and deep neural networks including an EEG-optimized temporal convolutional network (TCN) to the task of pathological versus non-pathological EEG classification. For a robust comparison, we chose the Temple University Hospital (TUH) Abnormal EEG Corpus (v2.0.0), which contains approximately 3000 EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that the proposed feature-based decoding framework can achieve accuracies on the same level as state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find accuracies across both approaches in an astonishingly narrow range from 81--86\%. Moreover, visualizations and analyses indicated that both approaches used similar aspects of the data, e.g., delta and theta band power at temporal electrode locations. We argue that the accuracies of current binary EEG pathology decoders could saturate near 90\% due to the imperfect inter-rater agreement of the clinical labels, and that such decoders are already clinically useful, such as in areas where clinical EEG experts are rare. We make the proposed feature-based framework available open source and thus offer a new tool for EEG machine learning research.</p></details> |  |

| **[Beyond Diagnosis: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs for Pathology Localization in Chest Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18015v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new Optic Nerve Head (ONH)-based prediction enhancement for the segmentation of atrophy and fovea. Models trained with 400 available training images achieved an AUC of 0.9867 for pathological myopia classification, and a Euclidean distance of 58.27 pixels on the fovea localization task, evaluated on a test set of 400 images. Dice and F1 metrics for semantic segmentation of lesions scored 0.9303 and 0.9869 on optic disc, 0.8001 and 0.9135 on retinal atrophy, and 0.8073 and 0.7059 on retinal detachment, respectively. Our work was acknowledged with an award in the context of the "PathologicAL Myopia detection from retinal images" challenge held during the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (April 2019). Considering that (pathological) myopia cases are often identified as false positives and negatives in classification systems for glaucoma, we envision that the current work could aid in future research to discriminate between glaucomatous and highly-myopic eyes, complemented by the localization and segmentation of landmarks such as fovea, optic disc and atrophy.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 2 figures, preprint to journal</p></details> |

We present PathSeqSAM, a novel approach that treats 2D pathology slices as sequential video frames using SAM2's memory mechanisms. Our method introduces a distance-aware attention mechanism that accounts for variable physical distances between slices and employs LoRA for domain adaptation. Evaluated on the KPI Challenge 2024 dataset for glomeruli segmentation, PathSeqSAM demonstrates improved segmentation quality, particularly in challenging cases that benefit from cross-slice context. We have publicly released our code at https://github.com/JackyyyWang/PathSeqSAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General-Purpose Self-Supervised Model for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.15474v1)** | 2023-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tissue phenotyping is a fundamental computational pathology (CPath) task in learning objective characterizations of histopathologic biomarkers in anatomic pathology. However, whole-slide imaging (WSI) poses a complex computer vision problem in which the large-scale image resolutions of WSIs and the enormous diversity of morphological phenotypes preclude large-scale data annotation. Current efforts have proposed using pretrained image encoders with either transfer learning from natural image datasets or self-supervised pretraining on publicly-available histopathology datasets, but have not been extensively developed and evaluated across diverse tissue types at scale. We introduce UNI, a general-purpose self-supervised model for pathology, pretrained using over 100 million tissue patches from over 100,000 diagnostic haematoxylin and eosin-stained WSIs across 20 major tissue types, and evaluated on 33 representative CPath clinical tasks in CPath of varying diagnostic difficulties. In addition to outperforming previous state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate new modeling capabilities in CPath such as resolution-agnostic tissue classification, slide classification using few-shot class prototypes, and disease subtyping generalization in classifying up to 108 cancer types in the OncoTree code classification system. UNI advances unsupervised representation learning at scale in CPath in terms of both pretraining data and downstream evaluation, enabling data-efficient AI models that can generalize and transfer to a gamut of diagnostically-challenging tasks and clinical workflows in anatomic pathology.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC), with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice pathology classification while reducing gender bias through hierarchical modeling of vocal characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning biologically relevant features in a pathology foundation model using sparse autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10785v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology plays an important role in disease diagnosis, treatment decision-making and drug development. Previous works on interpretability for machine learning models on pathology images have revolved around methods such as attention value visualization and deriving human-interpretable features from model heatmaps. Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging area of model interpretability that focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising direction in terms of extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic model activations. In this work, we trained a Sparse Autoencoder on the embeddings of a pathology pretrained foundation model. We found that Sparse Autoencoder features represent interpretable and monosemantic biological concepts. In particular, individual SAE dimensions showed strong correlations with cell type counts such as plasma cells and lymphocytes. These biological representations were unique to the pathology pretrained model and were not found in a self-supervised model pretrained on natural images. We demonstrated that such biologically-grounded monosemantic representations evolved across the model's depth, and the pathology foundation model eventually gained robustness to non-biological factors such as scanner type. The emergence of biologically relevant SAE features was generalizable to an out-of-domain dataset. Our work paves the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Progressive Images from Pathological Transitions via Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.12316v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is widely applied in computer-aided pathological diagnosis, which alleviates the pathologist workload and provide timely clinical analysis. However, most models generally require large-scale annotated data for training, which faces challenges due to the sampling and annotation scarcity in pathological images. The rapid developing generative models shows potential to generate more training samples from recent studies. However, they also struggle in generalization diversity with limited training data, incapable of generating effective samples. Inspired by the pathological transitions between different stages, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled diffusion (ADD) network to generate pathological progressive images for effective data augmentation. This novel approach roots in domain migration, where a hybrid attention strategy guides the bidirectional diffusion, blending local and global attention priorities. With feature measuring, the adaptive depth-controlled strategy ensures the migration and maintains locational similarity in simulating the pathological feature transition. Based on tiny training set (samples less than 500), the ADD yields cross-domain progressive images with corresponding soft-labels. Experiments on two datasets suggest significant improvements in generation diversity, and the effectiveness with generated progressive samples are highlighted in downstream classifications. The code is available at https://github.com/Rowerliu/ADD.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figs, 4 tabs</p></details> |

F-SEG allows the use of pre-trained deep neural networks, including recently developed pathology foundation models, for semantic segmentation. It achieves this without requiring additional training or finetuning, by factorizing the spatial features extracted by the models into segmentation masks and their associated concept features. We create generic tissue phenotypes for H&E images by training clustering models for multiple numbers of clusters on features extracted from several deep learning models on The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA), and then show how the clusters can be used for factorizing corresponding segmentation masks using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Our results show that F-SEG provides robust unsupervised segmentation capabilities for H&E pathology images, and that the segmentation quality is greatly improved by utilizing pathology foundation models. We discuss and propose methods for evaluating the performance of unsupervised segmentation in pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrPSeg: Universal Proposition Learning for Panoramic Renal Pathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19286v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the anatomy of renal pathology is crucial for advancing disease diagnostics, treatment evaluation, and clinical research. The complex kidney system comprises various components across multiple levels, including regions (cortex, medulla), functional units (glomeruli, tubules), and cells (podocytes, mesangial cells in glomerulus). Prior studies have predominantly overlooked the intricate spatial interrelations among objects from clinical knowledge. In this research, we introduce a novel universal proposition learning approach, called panoramic renal pathology segmentation (PrPSeg), designed to segment comprehensively panoramic structures within kidney by integrating extensive knowledge of kidney anatomy. In this paper, we propose (1) the design of a comprehensive universal proposition matrix for renal pathology, facilitating the incorporation of classification and spatial relationships into the segmentation process; (2) a token-based dynamic head single network architecture, with the improvement of the partial label image segmentation and capability for future data enlargement; and (3) an anatomy loss function, quantifying the inter-object relationships across the kidney.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE / CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference 2024</p></details> |

Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Current pathology domain adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing both computational and annotation costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Network for Joint Registration and Reconstruction of Images with Pathologies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07628v1)** | 2020-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Registration of images with pathologies is challenging due to tissue appearance changes and missing correspondences caused by the pathologies. Moreover, mass effects as observed for brain tumors may displace tissue, creating larger deformations over time than what is observed in a healthy brain. Deep learning models have successfully been applied to image registration to offer dramatic speed up and to use surrogate information (e.g., segmentations) during training. However, existing approaches focus on learning registration models using images from healthy patients. They are therefore not designed for the registration of images with strong pathologies for example in the context of brain tumors, and traumatic brain injuries. In this work, we explore a deep learning approach to register images with brain tumors to an atlas. Our model learns an appearance mapping from images with tumors to the atlas, while simultaneously predicting the transformation to atlas space. Using separate decoders, the network disentangles the tumor mass effect from the reconstruction of quasi-normal images. Results on both synthetic and real brain tumor scans show that our approach outperforms cost function masking for registration to the atlas and that reconstructed quasi-normal images can be used for better longitudinal registrations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind deblurring for microscopic pathology images using deep learning networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11879v1)** | 2020-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered pathology is a revolutionary step in the world of digital pathology and shows great promise to increase both diagnosis accuracy and efficiency. However, defocus and motion blur can obscure tissue or cell characteristics hence compromising AI algorithms'accuracy and robustness in analyzing the images. In this paper, we demonstrate a deep-learning-based approach that can alleviate the defocus and motion blur of a microscopic image and output a sharper and cleaner image with retrieved fine details without prior knowledge of the blur type, blur extent and pathological stain. In this approach, a deep learning classifier is first trained to identify the image blur type. Then, two encoder-decoder networks are trained and used alone or in combination to deblur the input image. It is an end-to-end approach and introduces no corrugated artifacts as traditional blind deconvolution methods do. We test our approach on different types of pathology specimens and demonstrate great performance on image blur correction and the subsequent improvement on the diagnosis outcome of AI algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathVLM-R1: A Reinforcement Learning-Driven Reasoning Model for Pathology Visual-Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09258v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diagnosis of pathological images is often limited by expert availability and regional disparities, highlighting the importance of automated diagnosis using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Traditional multimodal models typically emphasize outcomes over the reasoning process, compromising the reliability of clinical decisions. To address the weak reasoning abilities and lack of supervised processes in pathological VLMs, we have innovatively proposed PathVLM-R1, a visual language model designed specifically for pathological images. We have based our model on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and enhanced its performance for pathological tasks through meticulously designed post-training strategies. Firstly, we conduct supervised fine-tuning guided by pathological data to imbue the model with foundational pathological knowledge, forming a new pathological base model. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and propose a dual reward-driven reinforcement learning optimization, ensuring strict constraint on logical supervision of the reasoning process and accuracy of results via cross-modal process reward and outcome accuracy reward. In the pathological image question-answering tasks, the testing results of PathVLM-R1 demonstrate a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods, and it demonstrated superior performance compared to the Qwen2.5-VL-32B version despite having a significantly smaller parameter size. Furthermore, in out-domain data evaluation involving four medical imaging modalities: Computed Tomography (CT), dermoscopy, fundus photography, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images: PathVLM-R1's transfer performance improved by an average of 17.3% compared to traditional SFT methods. These results clearly indicate that PathVLM-R1 not only enhances accuracy but also possesses broad applicability and expansion potential.</p></details> |  |

A New Transformer Language Model for Pathology Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06885v1)** | 2022-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology text mining is a challenging task given the reporting variability and constant new findings in cancer sub-type definitions. However, successful text mining of a large pathology database can play a critical role to advance 'big data' cancer research like similarity-based treatment selection, case identification, prognostication, surveillance, clinical trial screening, risk stratification, and many others. While there is a growing interest in developing language models for more specific clinical domains, no pathology-specific language space exist to support the rapid data-mining development in pathology space. In literature, a few approaches fine-tuned general transformer models on specialized corpora while maintaining the original tokenizer, but in fields requiring specialized terminology, these models often fail to perform adequately. We propose PathologyBERT - a pre-trained masked language model which was trained on 347,173 histopathology specimen reports and publicly released in the Huggingface repository. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that pre-training of transformer model on pathology corpora yields performance improvements on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Breast Cancer Diagnose Classification when compared to nonspecific language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to "American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA)" 2022 Annual Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Generic Auto-ML Tools for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.03622v1)** | 2022-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image analysis tasks in computational pathology are commonly solved using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The selection of a suitable CNN architecture and hyperparameters is usually done through exploratory iterative optimization, which is computationally expensive and requires substantial manual work. The goal of this article is to evaluate how generic tools for neural network architecture search and hyperparameter optimization perform for common use cases in computational pathology. For this purpose, we evaluated one on-premises and one cloud-based tool for three different classification tasks for histological images: tissue classification, mutation prediction, and grading. We found that the default CNN architectures and parameterizations of the evaluated AutoML tools already yielded classification performance on par with the original publications. Hyperparameter optimization for these tasks did not substantially improve performance, despite the additional computational effort. However, performance varied substantially between classifiers obtained from individual AutoML runs due to non-deterministic effects. Generic CNN architectures and AutoML tools could thus be a viable alternative to manually optimizing CNN architectures and parametrizations. This would allow developers of software solutions for computational pathology to focus efforts on harder-to-automate tasks such as data curation.</p></details> |  |

Despite the recent trend of adopting deep-learning approaches for analyzing complex pathology images, they fall short as they often overlook the domain-expert understanding of tissue structure and cell composition. In this work, we focus on a challenging Open-ended Pathology VQA (PathVQA-Open) task and propose a novel framework named Path-RAG, which leverages HistoCartography to retrieve relevant domain knowledge from pathology images and significantly improves performance on PathVQA-Open. Admitting the complexity of pathology image analysis, Path-RAG adopts a human-centered AI approach by retrieving domain knowledge using HistoCartography to select the relevant patches from pathology images. Our experiments suggest that domain guidance can significantly boost the accuracy of LLaVA-Med from 38% to 47%, with a notable gain of 28% for H&E-stained pathology images in the PathVQA-Open dataset. For longer-form question and answer pairs, our model consistently achieves significant improvements of 32.5% in ARCH-Open PubMed and 30.6% in ARCH-Open Books on H\&E images. Our code and dataset is available here (https://github.com/embedded-robotics/path-rag).</p></details> |  |

While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

We show empirically that the pathology occurs for commonly chosen behavioral policy classes and demonstrate its impact on sample efficiency and online policy performance. Finally, we show that the pathology can be remedied by non-parametric behavioral reference policies and that this allows KL-regularized reinforcement learning to significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on a variety of challenging locomotion and dexterous hand manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (NeurIPS 2021)</p></details> |

However, integration into routine clinical practice has been slow due to numerous challenges, including technical and regulatory hurdles in translating research results into clinical diagnostic products and the lack of standardized interfaces. The open and vendor-neutral EMPAIA initiative addresses these challenges. Here, we provide an overview of EMPAIA's achievements and lessons learned. EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the pathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry. In close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards, recommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability methods. We implemented the modular and open-source EMPAIA platform and successfully integrated 14 AI-based image analysis apps from 8 different vendors, demonstrating how different apps can use a single standardized interface. We prioritized requirements and evaluated the use of AI in real clinical settings with 14 different pathology laboratories in Europe and Asia. In addition to technical developments, we created a forum for all stakeholders to share information and experiences on digital pathology and AI. Commercial, clinical, and academic stakeholders can now adopt EMPAIA's common open-source interfaces, providing a unique opportunity for large-scale standardization and streamlining of processes. Further efforts are needed to effectively and broadly establish AI assistance in routine laboratory use. To this end, a sustainable infrastructure, the non-profit association EMPAIA International, has been established to continue standardization and support broad implementation and advocacy for an AI-assisted digital pathology future.</p></details> |  |

The main objective for CPath is to develop infrastructure and workflows of digital diagnostics as an assistive CAD system for clinical pathology, facilitating transformational changes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer that are mainly address by CPath tools. With evergrowing developments in deep learning and computer vision algorithms, and the ease of the data flow from digital pathology, currently CPath is witnessing a paradigm shift. Despite the sheer volume of engineering and scientific works being introduced for cancer image analysis, there is still a considerable gap of adopting and integrating these algorithms in clinical practice. This raises a significant question regarding the direction and trends that are undertaken in CPath. In this article we provide a comprehensive review of more than 800 papers to address the challenges faced in problem design all-the-way to the application and implementation viewpoints. We have catalogued each paper into a model-card by examining the key works and challenges faced to layout the current landscape in CPath. We hope this helps the community to locate relevant works and facilitate understanding of the field's future directions. In a nutshell, we oversee the CPath developments in cycle of stages which are required to be cohesively linked together to address the challenges associated with such multidisciplinary science. We overview this cycle from different perspectives of data-centric, model-centric, and application-centric problems. We finally sketch remaining challenges and provide directions for future technical developments and clinical integration of CPath (https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/CPath_Survey).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Elsevier Journal of Pathology Informatics (JPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Open and reusable deep learning for pathology with WSInfer and QuPath](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.04631v1)** | 2024-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of digital pathology has seen a proliferation of deep learning models in recent years. Despite substantial progress, it remains rare for other researchers and pathologists to be able to access models published in the literature and apply them to their own images. This is due to difficulties in both sharing and running models. To address these concerns, we introduce WSInfer: a new, open-source software ecosystem designed to make deep learning for pathology more streamlined and accessible. WSInfer comprises three main elements: 1) a Python package and command line tool to efficiently apply patch-based deep learning inference to whole slide images; 2) a QuPath extension that provides an alternative inference engine through user-friendly and interactive software, and 3) a model zoo, which enables pathology models and metadata to be easily shared in a standardized form. Together, these contributions aim to encourage wider reuse, exploration, and interrogation of deep learning models for research purposes, by putting them into the hands of pathologists and eliminating a need for coding experience when accessed through QuPath. The WSInfer source code is hosted on GitHub and documentation is available at https://wsinfer.readthedocs.io.</p></details> |  |

However, deep learning models can be influenced by the color quality of the dataset used to train them, impacting detection, segmentation and classification tasks. In this work, we evaluate the impact of color correction on pathology detection using two prominent object detection models: Retinanet and YOLOv5. We first generate two color corrected versions of a popular WCE dataset (i.e., SEE-AI dataset) using two different color correction functions. We then evaluate the performance of the Retinanet and YOLOv5 on the original and color corrected versions of the dataset. The results reveal that color correction makes the models generate larger bounding boxes and larger intersection areas with the ground truth annotations. Furthermore, color correction leads to an increased number of false positives for certain pathologies. However, these effects do not translate into a consistent improvement in performance metrics such as F1-scores, IoU, and AP50. The code is available at https://github.com/agossouema2011/WCE2024.

Deep neural networks have the potential to identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains \textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496 patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from 2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients. It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification of ovarian tumors.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is appealing to such annotation-heavy tasks. Despite the extensive benchmarks in natural images for dense tasks, such studies are, unfortunately, absent in current works for pathology. Our paper intends to narrow this gap. We first benchmark representative SSL methods for dense prediction tasks in pathology images. Then, we propose concept contrastive learning (ConCL), an SSL framework for dense pre-training. We explore how ConCL performs with concepts provided by different sources and end up with proposing a simple dependency-free concept generating method that does not rely on external segmentation algorithms or saliency detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConCL over previous state-of-the-art SSL methods across different settings. Along our exploration, we distll several important and intriguing components contributing to the success of dense pre-training for pathology images. We hope this work could provide useful data points and encourage the community to conduct ConCL pre-training for problems of interest.

| **[Edge-competing Pathological Liver Vessel Segmentation with Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00384v1)** | 2021-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The microvascular invasion (MVI) is a major prognostic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma, which is one of the malignant tumors with the highest mortality rate. The diagnosis of MVI needs discovering the vessels that contain hepatocellular carcinoma cells and counting their number in each vessel, which depends heavily on experiences of the doctor, is largely subjective and time-consuming. However, there is no algorithm as yet tailored for the MVI detection from pathological images. This paper collects the first pathological liver image dataset containing 522 whole slide images with labels of vessels, MVI, and hepatocellular carcinoma grades. The first and essential step for the automatic diagnosis of MVI is the accurate segmentation of vessels. The unique characteristics of pathological liver images, such as super-large size, multi-scale vessel, and blurred vessel edges, make the accurate vessel segmentation challenging. Based on the collected dataset, we propose an Edge-competing Vessel Segmentation Network (EVS-Net), which contains a segmentation network and two edge segmentation discriminators. The segmentation network, combined with an edge-aware self-supervision mechanism, is devised to conduct vessel segmentation with limited labeled patches. Meanwhile, two discriminators are introduced to distinguish whether the segmented vessel and background contain residual features in an adversarial manner. In the training stage, two discriminators are devised tocompete for the predicted position of edges. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only limited labeled patches, EVS-Net achieves a close performance of fully supervised methods, which provides a convenient tool for the pathological liver vessel segmentation.

However, the implausible and distorted pathology features generated from the less than perfect generator may lead to wrong clinical decisions. Why not keep the original pathology region? We proposed a novel approach that allows our generative model to generate high quality plausible images that contain undistorted pathology areas. The main idea is to design a training scheme based on an image-to-image translation network to introduce variations of new lung features around the pathology ground-truth area. Moreover, our model is able to leverage both annotated disease images and unannotated healthy lung images for the purpose of generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two tasks: (i) we invite certified radiologists to assess the quality of the generated synthetic images against real and other state-of-the-art generative models, and (ii) data augmentation to improve the performance of disease localisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/yunyanxing/pairwise_xray_augmentation - Accepted to the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2019</p></details> |

These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |

Given inaccurate training labels, DL-FUMI learns a set of target dictionary atoms that describe the most distinctive and representative features of the true positive class as well as a set of nontarget dictionary atoms that account for the shared information found in both the positive and negative instances. Experimental results show that the estimated target dictionary atoms found by DL-FUMI are more representative prototypes and identify better discriminative features of the true positive class than existing methods in the literature. DL-FUMI is shown to have significantly better performance on several target detection and classification problems as compared to other multiple instance learning (MIL) dictionary learning algorithms on a variety of MIL problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final submission to ICPR</p></details> |
| **[Active Learning in Incomplete Label Multiple Instance Multiple Label Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.10804v2)** | 2021-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiple instance multiple label learning, each sample, a bag, consists of multiple instances. To alleviate labeling complexity, each sample is associated with a set of bag-level labels leaving instances within the bag unlabeled. This setting is more convenient and natural for representing complicated objects, which have multiple semantic meanings. Compared to single instance labeling, this approach allows for labeling larger datasets at an equivalent labeling cost. However, for sufficiently large datasets, labeling all bags may become prohibitively costly. Active learning uses an iterative labeling and retraining approach aiming to provide reasonable classification performance using a small number of labeled samples. To our knowledge, only a few works in the area of active learning in the MIML setting are available. These approaches can provide practical solutions to reduce labeling cost but their efficacy remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel bag-class pair based approach for active learning in the MIML setting. Due to the partial availability of bag-level labels, we focus on the incomplete-label MIML setting for the proposed active learning approach. Our approach is based on a discriminative graphical model with efficient and exact inference. For the query process, we adapt active learning criteria to the novel bag-class pair selection strategy. Additionally, we introduce an online stochastic gradient descent algorithm to provide an efficient model update after each query. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine learning, Multiple instance multiple label learning, Active learning, incomplete label learning</p></details> |
| **[Address Instance-level Label Prediction in Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12226v1)** | 2019-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\textit{Multiple Instance Learning} (MIL) is concerned with learning from bags of instances, where only bag labels are given and instance labels are unknown. Existent approaches in this field were mainly designed for the bag-level label prediction (predict labels for bags) but not the instance-level (predict labels for instances), with the task loss being only defined at the bag level. This restricts their application in many tasks, where the instance-level labels are more interested. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, whose loss is specifically defined at the instance level, to address instance-level label prediction in MIL. We prove that the loss of this algorithm can be unbiasedly and consistently estimated without using instance labels, under the i.i.d assumption. Empirical study validates the above statements and shows that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior instance-level and comparative bag-level performance, compared to state-of-the-art MIL methods. In addition, it shows that the proposed method can achieve similar results as the fully supervised model (trained with instance labels) for label prediction at the instance level.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work address Multiple Instance Learning</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning with Bag Dissimilarities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.5643v3)** | 2014-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is concerned with learning from sets (bags) of objects (instances), where the individual instance labels are ambiguous. In this setting, supervised learning cannot be applied directly. Often, specialized MIL methods learn by making additional assumptions about the relationship of the bag labels and instance labels. Such assumptions may fit a particular dataset, but do not generalize to the whole range of MIL problems. Other MIL methods shift the focus of assumptions from the labels to the overall (dis)similarity of bags, and therefore learn from bags directly. We propose to represent each bag by a vector of its dissimilarities to other bags in the training set, and treat these dissimilarities as a feature representation. We show several alternatives to define a dissimilarity between bags and discuss which definitions are more suitable for particular MIL problems. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is computationally inexpensive, yet very competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on a wide range of MIL datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Patte...</summary><p>Pattern Recognition, in press</p></details> |
| **[Root Identification in Minirhizotron Imagery with Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03207v3)** | 2020-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms to automatically perform root detection and segmentation in minirhizotron imagery using only image-level labels are proposed. Root and soil characteristics vary from location to location, thus, supervised machine learning approaches that are trained with local data provide the best ability to identify and segment roots in minirhizotron imagery. However, labeling roots for training data (or otherwise) is an extremely tedious and time-consuming task. This paper aims to address this problem by labeling data at the image level (rather than the individual root or root pixel level) and train algorithms to perform individual root pixel level segmentation using MIL strategies. Three MIL methods (multiple instance adaptive cosine coherence estimator, multiple instance support vector machine, multiple instance learning with randomized trees) were applied to root detection and compared to non-MIL approches. The results show that MIL methods improve root segmentation in challenging minirhizotron imagery and reduce the labeling burden. In our results, multiple instance support vector machine outperformed other methods. The multiple instance adaptive cosine coherence estimator algorithm was a close second with an added advantage that it learned an interpretable root signature which identified the traits used to distinguish roots from soil and did not require parameter selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple instance active learning for object detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02324v1)** | 2021-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the substantial progress of active learning for image recognition, there still lacks an instance-level active learning method specified for object detection. In this paper, we propose Multiple Instance Active Object Detection (MI-AOD), to select the most informative images for detector training by observing instance-level uncertainty. MI-AOD defines an instance uncertainty learning module, which leverages the discrepancy of two adversarial instance classifiers trained on the labeled set to predict instance uncertainty of the unlabeled set. MI-AOD treats unlabeled images as instance bags and feature anchors in images as instances, and estimates the image uncertainty by re-weighting instances in a multiple instance learning (MIL) fashion. Iterative instance uncertainty learning and re-weighting facilitate suppressing noisy instances, toward bridging the gap between instance uncertainty and image-level uncertainty. Experiments validate that MI-AOD sets a solid baseline for instance-level active learning. On commonly used object detection datasets, MI-AOD outperforms state-of-the-art methods with significant margins, particularly when the labeled sets are small.

| **[Dissimilarity-based Ensembles for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.1349v1)** | 2016-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiple instance learning, objects are sets (bags) of feature vectors (instances) rather than individual feature vectors. In this paper we address the problem of how these bags can best be represented. Two standard approaches are to use (dis)similarities between bags and prototype bags, or between bags and prototype instances. The first approach results in a relatively low-dimensional representation determined by the number of training bags, while the second approach results in a relatively high-dimensional representation, determined by the total number of instances in the training set. In this paper a third, intermediate approach is proposed, which links the two approaches and combines their strengths. Our classifier is inspired by a random subspace ensemble, and considers subspaces of the dissimilarity space, defined by subsets of instances, as prototypes. We provide guidelines for using such an ensemble, and show state-of-the-art performances on a range of multiple instance learning problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, Special Issue on Learning in Non-(geo)metric Spaces</p></details> |

Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data are presented to illustrate the versatility of the proposed solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nested Multiple Instance Learning with Attention Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.00947v3)** | 2022-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Strongly supervised learning requires detailed knowledge of truth labels at instance levels, and in many machine learning applications this is a major drawback. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular weakly supervised learning method where truth labels are not available at instance level, but only at bag-of-instances level. However, sometimes the nature of the problem requires a more complex description, where a nested architecture of bag-of-bags at different levels can capture underlying relationships, like similar instances grouped together. Predicting the latent labels of instances or inner-bags might be as important as predicting the final bag-of-bags label but is lost in a straightforward nested setting. We propose a Nested Multiple Instance with Attention (NMIA) model architecture combining the concept of nesting with attention mechanisms. We show that NMIA performs as conventional MIL in simple scenarios and can grasp a complex scenario providing insights to the latent labels at different levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICIP 2022</p></details> |
| **[Certainty Pooling for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10548v1)** | 2020-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning is a form of weakly supervised learning in which the data is arranged in sets of instances called bags with one label assigned per bag. The bag level class prediction is derived from the multiple instances through application of a permutation invariant pooling operator on instance predictions or embeddings. We present a novel pooling operator called \textbf{Certainty Pooling} which incorporates the model certainty into bag predictions resulting in a more robust and explainable model. We compare our proposed method with other pooling operators in controlled experiments with low evidence ratio bags based on MNIST, as well as on a real life histopathology dataset - Camelyon16. Our method outperforms other methods in both bag level and instance level prediction, especially when only small training sets are available. We discuss the rationale behind our approach and the reasons for its superiority for these types of datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIGMIL: Positive Instance Detection via Graph Updating for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03550v1)** | 2016-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Positive instance detection, especially for these in positive bags (true positive instances, TPIs), plays a key role for multiple instance learning (MIL) arising from a specific classification problem only provided with bag (a set of instances) label information. However, most previous MIL methods on this issue ignore the global similarity among positive instances and that negative instances are non-i.i.d., usually resulting in the detection of TPI not precise and sensitive to outliers. To the end, we propose a positive instance detection via graph updating for multiple instance learning, called PIGMIL, to detect TPI accurately. PIGMIL selects instances from working sets (WSs) of some working bags (WBs) as positive candidate pool (PCP). The global similarity among positive instances and the robust discrimination of instances of PCP from negative instances are measured to construct the consistent similarity and discrimination graph (CSDG). As a result, the primary goal (i.e. TPI detection) is transformed into PCP updating, which is approximated efficiently by updating CSDG with a random walk ranking algorithm and an instance updating strategy. At last bags are transformed into feature representation vector based on the identified TPIs to train a classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high precision of PIGMIL's detection of TPIs and its excellent performance compared to classic baseline MIL methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Bag-Level Aggregation for Multiple Instance Active Learning in Instance Classification Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02584v1)** | 2022-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A growing number of applications, e.g. video surveillance and medical image analysis, require training recognition systems from large amounts of weakly annotated data while some targeted interactions with a domain expert are allowed to improve the training process. In such cases, active learning (AL) can reduce labeling costs for training a classifier by querying the expert to provide the labels of most informative instances. This paper focuses on AL methods for instance classification problems in multiple instance learning (MIL), where data is arranged into sets, called bags, that are weakly labeled. Most AL methods focus on single instance learning problems. These methods are not suitable for MIL problems because they cannot account for the bag structure of data. In this paper, new methods for bag-level aggregation of instance informativeness are proposed for multiple instance active learning (MIAL). The \textit{aggregated informativeness} method identifies the most informative instances based on classifier uncertainty, and queries bags incorporating the most information. The other proposed method, called \textit{cluster-based aggregative sampling}, clusters data hierarchically in the instance space. The informativeness of instances is assessed by considering bag labels, inferred instance labels, and the proportion of labels that remain to be discovered in clusters. Both proposed methods significantly outperform reference methods in extensive experiments using benchmark data from several application domains. Results indicate that using an appropriate strategy to address MIAL problems yields a significant reduction in the number of queries needed to achieve the same level of performance as single instance AL methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we state the MIL problem as learning the Bernoulli distribution of the bag label where the bag label probability is fully parameterized by neural networks. Furthermore, we propose a neural network-based permutation-invariant aggregation operator that corresponds to the attention mechanism. Notably, an application of the proposed attention-based operator provides insight into the contribution of each instance to the bag label. We show empirically that our approach achieves comparable performance to the best MIL methods on benchmark MIL datasets and it outperforms other methods on a MNIST-based MIL dataset and two real-life histopathology datasets without sacrificing interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2018 paper, code source: https://github.com/AMLab-Amsterdam/AttentionDeepMIL</p></details> |

| **[On the Complexity of One-class SVM for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04947v1)** | 2016-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional multiple instance learning (MIL), both positive and negative bags are required to learn a prediction function. However, a high human cost is needed to know the label of each bag---positive or negative. Only positive bags contain our focus (positive instances) while negative bags consist of noise or background (negative instances). So we do not expect to spend too much to label the negative bags. Contrary to our expectation, nearly all existing MIL methods require enough negative bags besides positive ones. In this paper we propose an algorithm called "Positive Multiple Instance" (PMI), which learns a classifier given only a set of positive bags. So the annotation of negative bags becomes unnecessary in our method. PMI is constructed based on the assumption that the unknown positive instances in positive bags be similar each other and constitute one compact cluster in feature space and the negative instances locate outside this cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that PMI achieves the performances close to or a little worse than those of the traditional MIL algorithms on benchmark and real data sets. However, the number of training bags in PMI is reduced significantly compared with traditional MIL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Thus, they can be used to learn instance-level models in a weakly supervised manner. Our empirical evaluation on both simplified (MNIST) and realistic (Lookbook and Histopathology) datasets shows that LSTMs are competitive with or even surpass state-of-the-art methods specially designed for handling specific MIL problems.

| **[Multiple Instance Learning for Uplift Modeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.09639v1)** | 2023-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uplift modeling is widely used in performance marketing to estimate effects of promotion campaigns (e.g., increase of customer retention rate). Since it is impossible to observe outcomes of a recipient in treatment (e.g., receiving a certain promotion) and control (e.g., without promotion) groups simultaneously (i.e., counter-factual), uplift models are mainly trained on instances of treatment and control groups separately to form two models respectively, and uplifts are predicted by the difference of predictions from these two models (i.e., two-model method). When responses are noisy and the treatment effect is fractional, induced individual uplift predictions will be inaccurate, resulting in targeting undesirable customers. Though it is impossible to obtain the ideal ground-truth individual uplifts, known as Individual Treatment Effects (ITEs), alternatively, an average uplift of a group of users, called Average Treatment Effect (ATE), can be observed from experimental deliveries. Upon this, similar to Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) in which each training sample is a bag of instances, our framework sums up individual user uplift predictions for each bag of users as its bag-wise ATE prediction, and regularizes it to its ATE label, thus learning more accurate individual uplifts. Additionally, to amplify the fractional treatment effect, bags are composed of instances with adjacent individual uplift predictions, instead of random instances. Experiments conducted on two datasets show the effectiveness and universality of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>short...</summary><p>short paper of CIKM22(full version)</p></details> |
| **[A Visual Mining Approach to Improved Multiple-Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07257v2)** | 2021-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is a paradigm of machine learning that aims to classify a set (bag) of objects (instances), assigning labels only to the bags. This problem is often addressed by selecting an instance to represent each bag, transforming a MIL problem into standard supervised learning. Visualization can be a useful tool to assess learning scenarios by incorporating the users' knowledge into the classification process. Considering that multiple-instance learning is a paradigm that cannot be handled by current visualization techniques, we propose a multiscale tree-based visualization called MILTree to support MIL problems. The first level of the tree represents the bags, and the second level represents the instances belonging to each bag, allowing users to understand the MIL datasets in an intuitive way. In addition, we propose two new instance selection methods for MIL, which help users improve the model even further. Our methods can handle both binary and multiclass scenarios. In our experiments, SVM was used to build the classifiers. With support of the MILTree layout, the initial classification model was updated by changing the training set, which is composed of the prototype instances. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that visual mining by MILTree can support exploring and improving models in MIL scenarios and that our instance selection methods outperform the currently available alternatives in most cases.</p></details> |  |

| **[LadderMIL: Multiple Instance Learning with Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02707v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology often neglects instance-level learning as supervision is typically provided only at the bag level, hindering the integrated consideration of instance and bag-level information during the analysis. In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multiclass Multiple Instance Learning Method with Exact Likelihood](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12346v2)** | 2019-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a multiclass multiple instance learning (MIL) problem where the labels only suggest whether any instance of a class exists or does not exist in a training sample or example. No further information, e.g., the number of instances of each class, relative locations or orders of all instances in a training sample, is exploited. Such a weak supervision learning problem can be exactly solved by maximizing the model likelihood fitting given observations, and finds applications to tasks like multiple object detection and localization for image understanding. We discuss its relationship to the classic classification problem, the traditional MIL, and connectionist temporal classification (CTC). We use image recognition as the example task to develop our method, although it is applicable to data with higher or lower dimensions without much modification. Experimental results show that our method can be used to learn all convolutional neural networks for solving real-world multiple object detection and localization tasks with weak annotations, e.g., transcribing house number sequences from the Google street view imagery dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>McMIL...</summary><p>McMIL maximizing exact model likelihood.

| **[Fully Convolutional Multi-Class Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7144v4)** | 2015-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) can reduce the need for costly annotation in tasks such as semantic segmentation by weakening the required degree of supervision. We propose a novel MIL formulation of multi-class semantic segmentation learning by a fully convolutional network. In this setting, we seek to learn a semantic segmentation model from just weak image-level labels. The model is trained end-to-end to jointly optimize the representation while disambiguating the pixel-image label assignment. Fully convolutional training accepts inputs of any size, does not need object proposal pre-processing, and offers a pixelwise loss map for selecting latent instances. Our multi-class MIL loss exploits the further supervision given by images with multiple labels. We evaluate this approach through preliminary experiments on the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge.</p></details> | in ICLR 2015 |
| **[Learning from Multiple Annotators by Incorporating Instance Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15146v1)** | 2021-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from multiple annotators aims to induce a high-quality classifier from training instances, where each of them is associated with a set of possibly noisy labels provided by multiple annotators under the influence of their varying abilities and own biases. In modeling the probability transition process from latent true labels to observed labels, most existing methods adopt class-level confusion matrices of annotators that observed labels do not depend on the instance features, just determined by the true labels. It may limit the performance that the classifier can achieve. In this work, we propose the noise transition matrix, which incorporates the influence of instance features on annotators' performance based on confusion matrices. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective learning framework, which consists of a classifier module and a noise transition matrix module in a unified neural network architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label Stability in Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04986v1)** | 2017-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of \emph{instance label stability} in multiple instance learning (MIL) classifiers. These classifiers are trained only on globally annotated images (bags), but often can provide fine-grained annotations for image pixels or patches (instances). This is interesting for computer aided diagnosis (CAD) and other medical image analysis tasks for which only a coarse labeling is provided. Unfortunately, the instance labels may be unstable. This means that a slight change in training data could potentially lead to abnormalities being detected in different parts of the image, which is undesirable from a CAD point of view. Despite MIL gaining popularity in the CAD literature, this issue has not yet been addressed. We investigate the stability of instance labels provided by several MIL classifiers on 5 different datasets, of which 3 are medical image datasets (breast histopathology, diabetic retinopathy and computed tomography lung images). We propose an unsupervised measure to evaluate instance stability, and demonstrate that a performance-stability trade-off can be made when comparing MIL classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at MICCAI 2015</p></details> |
| **[A bag-to-class divergence approach to multiple-instance learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02782v2)** | 2018-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-instance (MI) learning, each object (bag) consists of multiple feature vectors (instances), and is most commonly regarded as a set of points in a multidimensional space. A different viewpoint is that the instances are realisations of random vectors with corresponding probability distribution, and that a bag is the distribution, not the realisations. In MI classification, each bag in the training set has a class label, but the instances are unlabelled. By introducing the probability distribution space to bag-level classification problems, dissimilarities between probability distributions (divergences) can be applied. The bag-to-bag Kullback-Leibler information is asymptotically the best classifier, but the typical sparseness of MI training sets is an obstacle. We introduce bag-to-class divergence to MI learning, emphasising the hierarchical nature of the random vectors that makes bags from the same class different. We propose two properties for bag-to-class divergences, and an additional property for sparse training sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Majority Label: A Novel Problem in Multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04023v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

| **[Sparse Network Inversion for Key Instance Detection in Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02909v2)** | 2020-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) involves predicting a single label for a bag of instances, given positive or negative labels at bag-level, without accessing to label for each instance in the training phase. Since a positive bag contains both positive and negative instances, it is often required to detect positive instances (key instances) when a set of instances is categorized as a positive bag. The attention-based deep MIL model is a recent advance in both bag-level classification and key instance detection (KID). However, if the positive and negative instances in a positive bag are not clearly distinguishable, the attention-based deep MIL model has limited KID performance as the attention scores are skewed to few positive instances. In this paper, we present a method to improve the attention-based deep MIL model in the task of KID. The main idea is to use the neural network inversion to find which instances made contribution to the bag-level prediction produced by the trained MIL model. Moreover, we incorporate a sparseness constraint into the neural network inversion, leading to the sparse network inversion which is solved by the proximal gradient method. Numerical experiments on an MNIST-based image MIL dataset and two real-world histopathology datasets verify the validity of our method, demonstrating the KID performance is significantly improved while the performance of bag-level prediction is maintained.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, in Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2020)</p></details> |
| **[Accounting for Dependencies in Deep Learning Based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01556v1)** | 2021-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a key algorithm for classification of whole slide images (WSI). Histology WSIs can have billions of pixels, which create enormous computational and annotation challenges. Typically, such images are divided into a set of patches (a bag of instances), where only bag-level class labels are provided. Deep learning based MIL methods calculate instance features using convolutional neural network (CNN). Our proposed approach is also deep learning based, with the following two contributions: Firstly, we propose to explicitly account for dependencies between instances during training by embedding self-attention Transformer blocks to capture dependencies between instances. For example, a tumor grade may depend on the presence of several particular patterns at different locations in WSI, which requires to account for dependencies between patches. Secondly, we propose an instance-wise loss function based on instance pseudo-labels. We compare the proposed algorithm to multiple baseline methods, evaluate it on the PANDA challenge dataset, the largest publicly available WSI dataset with over 11K images, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | MICCAI 2021 |

Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2025 workshop on Efficient Medical AI</p></details> |

This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Such image data usually come in the form of gigapixel-sized whole-slide-images (WSI) that are cropped into smaller patches (instances). However, the sheer size of the data makes training of ABMIL models challenging. All the instances from one WSI cannot be processed at once by conventional GPUs. Existing solutions compromise training by relying on pre-trained models, strategic sampling or selection of instances, or self-supervised learning. We propose a training strategy based on gradient accumulation that enables direct end-to-end training of ABMIL models without being limited by GPU memory. We conduct experiments on both QMNIST and Imagenette to investigate the performance and training time, and compare with the conventional memory-expensive baseline and a recent sampled-based approach. This memory-efficient approach, although slower, reaches performance indistinguishable from the memory-expensive baseline.</p></details> |  |

In typical MIL settings, a unit of data is given as a set of instances called a bag and the goal is to find a good classifier of bags based on similarity from a single or finitely many "shapelets" (or patterns), where the similarity of the bag from a shapelet is the maximum similarity of instances in the bag. Classifiers based on a single shapelet are not sufficiently strong for certain applications. Additionally, previous work with multiple shapelets has heuristically chosen some of the instances as shapelets with no theoretical guarantee of its generalization ability. Our formulation provides a richer class of the final classifiers based on infinitely many shapelets. We provide an efficient algorithm for the new formulation, in addition to generalization bound. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach is effective not only for MIL tasks but also for Shapelet Learning for time-series classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The preliminary version of this paper is arXiv:1709.01300. which only focuses on shapelet-based time-series classification but not Muptiple-Instance Learning.

A bag label is often only determined by a handful of key instances within a bag, making it difficult to interpret what information a classifier is using to make decisions. In this work, we establish the key requirements for interpreting MIL models. We then go on to develop several model-agnostic approaches that meet these requirements. Our methods are compared against existing inherently interpretable MIL models on several datasets, and achieve an increase in interpretability accuracy of up to 30%. We also examine the ability of the methods to identify interactions between instances and scale to larger datasets, improving their applicability to real-world problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages (9 content, 2 acknowledgement + references, 14 appendix). 16 figures (3 main content, 13 appendix).

Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Deep Multiple Instance Feature Learning via Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02490v1)** | 2018-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a novel weakly supervised deep learning framework that combines both the discriminative and generative models to learn meaningful representation in the multiple instance learning (MIL) setting. MIL is a weakly supervised learning problem where labels are associated with groups of instances (referred as bags) instead of individual instances. To address the essential challenge in MIL problems raised from the uncertainty of positive instances label, we use a discriminative model regularized by variational autoencoders (VAEs) to maximize the differences between latent representations of all instances and negative instances. As a result, the hidden layer of the variational autoencoder learns meaningful representation. This representation can effectively be used for MIL problems as illustrated by better performance on the standard benchmark datasets comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches. More importantly, unlike most related studies, the proposed framework can be easily scaled to large dataset problems, as illustrated by the audio event detection and segmentation task. Visualization also confirms the effectiveness of the latent representation in discriminating positive and negative classes.</p></details> | AAAI 2018 |

Existing methods either train an instance classifier through pseudo-labeling or aggregate instance features into a bag feature through attention mechanisms and then train a bag classifier, where the attention scores can be used for instance-level classification. However, the pseudo instance labels constructed by the former usually contain a lot of noise, and the attention scores constructed by the latter are not accurate enough, both of which affect their performance. In this paper, we propose an instance-level MIL framework based on contrastive learning and prototype learning to effectively accomplish both instance classification and bag classification tasks. To this end, we propose an instance-level weakly supervised contrastive learning algorithm for the first time under the MIL setting to effectively learn instance feature representation. We also propose an accurate pseudo label generation method through prototype learning. We then develop a joint training strategy for weakly supervised contrastive learning, prototype learning, and instance classifier training. Extensive experiments and visualizations on four datasets demonstrate the powerful performance of our method.

In this work, we investigate the use of four attribution methods to explain a multiple instance learning models: GradCAM, Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA), and InputIBA. With this collection of methods, we can derive pixel-level explanations on for the task of diagnosing blood cancer from patients' blood smears. We study two datasets of acute myeloid leukemia with over 100 000 single cell images and observe how each attribution method performs on the multiple instance learning architecture focusing on different properties of the white blood single cells. Additionally, we compare attribution maps with the annotations of a medical expert to see how the model's decision-making differs from the human standard.

Standard supervised training requires bounding box annotations of object instances. This time-consuming annotation process is sidestepped in weakly supervised learning. In this case, the supervised information is restricted to binary labels that indicate the absence/presence of object instances in the image, without their locations. We follow a multiple-instance learning approach that iteratively trains the detector and infers the object locations in the positive training images. Our main contribution is a multi-fold multiple instance learning procedure, which prevents training from prematurely locking onto erroneous object locations. This procedure is particularly important when using high-dimensional representations, such as Fisher vectors and convolutional neural network features. We also propose a window refinement method, which improves the localization accuracy by incorporating an objectness prior. We present a detailed experimental evaluation using the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset, which verifies the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |

In our formulation, we use all possible, and thus infinitely many shapelets, resulting in a richer class of classifiers. We show that the formulation is tractable, that is, it can be reduced through Linear Programming Boosting (LPBoost) to Difference of Convex (DC) programs of finite (actually polynomial) size. Our theoretical result also gives justification to the heuristics of some of the previous work. The time complexity of the proposed algorithm highly depends on the size of the set of all instances in the training sample. To apply to the data containing a large number of instances, we also propose a heuristic option of the algorithm without the loss of the theoretical guarantee. Our empirical study demonstrates that our algorithm uniformly works for Shapelet Learning tasks on time-series classification and various MIL tasks with comparable accuracy to the existing methods.

Recent works have shown promising results using contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL), which learns to push apart representations corresponding to two different randomly-selected instances. Unfortunately, in real-world applications such as medical image classification, there is often class imbalance, so randomly-selected instances mostly belong to the same majority class, which precludes CSSL from learning inter-class differences. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Iterative Self-paced Supervised Contrastive Learning for MIL Representations (ItS2CLR), which improves the learned representation by exploiting instance-level pseudo labels derived from the bag-level labels. The framework employs a novel self-paced sampling strategy to ensure the accuracy of pseudo labels. We evaluate ItS2CLR on three medical datasets, showing that it improves the quality of instance-level pseudo labels and representations, and outperforms existing MIL methods in terms of both bag and instance level accuracy.

A major line of WSOD methods roots in multiple instance learning which regards images as bags of instances and selects positive instances from each bag to learn the detector. However, a grand challenge emerges when the detector inclines to converge to discriminative parts of objects rather than the whole objects. In this paper, under the hypothesis that optimal solutions are included in local minima, we propose a discovery-and-selection approach fused with multiple instance learning (DS-MIL), which finds rich local minima and select optimal solution from multiple local minima. To implement DS-MIL, an attention module is proposed so that more context information can be captured by feature maps and more valuable proposals can be collected during training. With proposal candidates, a selection module is proposed to select informative instances for object detector. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks show that our proposed DS-MIL approach can consistently improve the baselines, reporting state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Instance-level loss based multiple-instance learning framework for acoustic scene classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08439v2)** | 2022-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the acoustic scene classification (ASC) task, an acoustic scene consists of diverse sounds and is inferred by identifying combinations of distinct attributes among them. This study aims to extract and cluster these attributes effectively using an improved multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for ASC. MIL, known as a weakly supervised learning method, is a strategy for extracting an instance from a bundle of frames composing an input audio clip and inferring a scene corresponding to the input data using these unlabeled instances. However, many studies pointed out an underestimation problem of MIL. In this study, we develop a MIL framework more suitable for ASC systems by defining instance-level labels and loss to extract and cluster instances effectively. Furthermore, we design a fully separated convolutional module, which is a lightweight neural network comprising pointwise, frequency-sided depthwise, and temporal-sided depthwise convolutional filters. As a result, compared to vanilla MIL, the confidence and proportion of positive instances increase significantly, overcoming the underestimation problem and improving the classification accuracy up to 11%. The proposed system achieved a performance of 81.1% and 72.3% on the TAU urban acoustic scenes 2019 and 2020 mobile datasets with 139 K parameters, respectively. Especially, it achieves the highest performance among the systems having under the 1 M parameters on the TAU urban acoustic scenes 2019 dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProMIL: Probabilistic Multiple Instance Learning for Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.10535v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a weakly-supervised problem in which one label is assigned to the whole bag of instances. An important class of MIL models is instance-based, where we first classify instances and then aggregate those predictions to obtain a bag label. The most common MIL model is when we consider a bag as positive if at least one of its instances has a positive label. However, this reasoning does not hold in many real-life scenarios, where the positive bag label is often a consequence of a certain percentage of positive instances. To address this issue, we introduce a dedicated instance-based method called ProMIL, based on deep neural networks and Bernstein polynomial estimation. An important advantage of ProMIL is that it can automatically detect the optimal percentage level for decision-making. We show that ProMIL outperforms standard instance-based MIL in real-world medical applications.

| **[User Personalized Satisfaction Prediction via Multiple Instance Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08096v1)** | 2016-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community based question answering services have arisen as a popular knowledge sharing pattern for netizens. With abundant interactions among users, individuals are capable of obtaining satisfactory information. However, it is not effective for users to attain answers within minutes. Users have to check the progress over time until the satisfying answers submitted. We address this problem as a user personalized satisfaction prediction task. Existing methods usually exploit manual feature selection. It is not desirable as it requires careful design and is labor intensive. In this paper, we settle this issue by developing a new multiple instance deep learning framework. Specifically, in our settings, each question follows a weakly supervised learning multiple instance learning assumption, where its obtained answers can be regarded as instance sets and we define the question resolved with at least one satisfactory answer. We thus design an efficient framework exploiting multiple instance learning property with deep learning to model the question answer pairs. Extensive experiments on large scale datasets from Stack Exchange demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed framework in predicting askers personalized satisfaction. Our framework can be extended to numerous applications such as UI satisfaction Prediction, multi armed bandit problem, expert finding and so on.</p></details> | draft for www |
| **[Quantitative Evaluation of Multiple Instance Learning Reliability For WSIs Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11110v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models have become integral to many fields, but their reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains, remains a critical concern. Reliability refers to the quality of being dependable and trustworthy. Reliable models consistently provide predictions aligned with basic domain knowledge, making their development and deployment particularly critical in healthcare applications. However, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models designed for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification in computational pathology are rarely evaluated in terms of reliability. In this paper, we address this gap by comparing the reliability of MIL models using three proposed metrics, applied across three region-wise annotated datasets. Our findings indicate that the mean pooling instance (MEAN-POOL-INS) model demonstrates superior reliability compared to other networks, despite its simple architectural design and computational efficiency. The code for reproducing our results is available at github.com/tueimage/MIL-Reliability.

| **[Multiple Instance Learning with Mixed Supervision in Gleason Grading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12798v1)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of computational pathology, deep learning methods for Gleason grading through whole slide images (WSIs) have excellent prospects. Since the size of WSIs is extremely large, the image label usually contains only slide-level label or limited pixel-level labels. The current mainstream approach adopts multi-instance learning to predict Gleason grades. However, some methods only considering the slide-level label ignore the limited pixel-level labels containing rich local information. Furthermore, the method of additionally considering the pixel-level labels ignores the inaccuracy of pixel-level labels. To address these problems, we propose a mixed supervision Transformer based on the multiple instance learning framework. The model utilizes both slide-level label and instance-level labels to achieve more accurate Gleason grading at the slide level. The impact of inaccurate instance-level labels is further reduced by introducing an efficient random masking strategy in the mixed supervision training process. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the SICAPv2 dataset, and the visual analysis shows the accurate prediction results of instance level.

It aims to combine the advantages of inter-instance discrimination by learning discriminative features to distinguish between different instances, as well as intra-instance variations by matching queries against the variants of augmented samples over instances. Particularly, for each instance, it constructs an instance subspace to model the configuration of how the significant factors of variations in $K$-shot augmentations can be combined to form the variants of augmentations. Given a query, the most relevant variant of instances is then retrieved by projecting the query onto their subspaces to predict the positive instance class. This generalizes the existing contrastive learning that can be viewed as a special one-shot case. An eigenvalue decomposition is performed to configure instance subspaces, and the embedding network can be trained end-to-end through the differentiable subspace configuration. Experiment results demonstrate the proposed $K$-shot contrastive learning achieves superior performances to the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Multiple-Instance Learning Models For Quantitative Electromyography](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.6811v1)** | 2013-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a comprehensive study of the use of generative modeling approaches for Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) problems. In MIL a learner receives training instances grouped together into bags with labels for the bags only (which might not be correct for the comprised instances). Our work was motivated by the task of facilitating the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders using sets of motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) detected within a muscle which can be cast as a MIL problem. Our approach leads to a state-of-the-art solution to the problem of muscle classification. By introducing and analyzing generative models for MIL in a general framework and examining a variety of model structures and components, our work also serves as a methodological guide to modelling MIL tasks. We evaluate our proposed methods both on MUPT datasets and on the MUSK1 dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks for MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2013)</p></details> |

Linear models and average cell type expressions are typically favored for this task for their efficiency and robustness, but they overlook the rich cell heterogeneity inherent in single-cell data. To address this gap, we introduce MixMIL, a framework integrating Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), upholding the advantages of linear models while modeling cell state heterogeneity. By leveraging predefined cell embeddings, MixMIL enhances computational efficiency and aligns with recent advancements in single-cell representation learning.

| **[Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08178v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors.

| **[Anomaly-aware multiple instance learning for rare anemia disorder classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01742v1)** | 2022-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based classification of rare anemia disorders is challenged by the lack of training data and instance-level annotations. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has shown to be an effective solution, yet it suffers from low accuracy and limited explainability. Although the inclusion of attention mechanisms has addressed these issues, their effectiveness highly depends on the amount and diversity of cells in the training samples. Consequently, the poor machine learning performance on rare anemia disorder classification from blood samples remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose an interpretable pooling method for MIL to address these limitations. By benefiting from instance-level information of negative bags (i.e., homogeneous benign cells from healthy individuals), our approach increases the contribution of anomalous instances. We show that our strategy outperforms standard MIL classification algorithms and provides a meaningful explanation behind its decisions. Moreover, it can denote anomalous instances of rare blood diseases that are not seen during the training phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Target Multiple Instance Learning for Hyperspectral Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03316v3)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In remote sensing, it is often challenging to acquire or collect a large dataset that is accurately labeled. This difficulty is usually due to several issues, including but not limited to the study site's spatial area and accessibility, errors in the global positioning system (GPS), and mixed pixels caused by an image's spatial resolution. We propose an approach, with two variations, that estimates multiple target signatures from training samples with imprecise labels: Multi-Target Multiple Instance Adaptive Cosine Estimator (Multi-Target MI-ACE) and Multi-Target Multiple Instance Spectral Match Filter (Multi-Target MI-SMF). The proposed methods address the problems above by directly considering the multiple-instance, imprecisely labeled dataset. They learn a dictionary of target signatures that optimizes detection against a background using the Adaptive Cosine Estimator (ACE) and Spectral Match Filter (SMF). Experiments were conducted to test the proposed algorithms using a simulated hyperspectral dataset, the MUUFL Gulfport hyperspectral dataset collected over the University of Southern Mississippi-Gulfpark Campus, and the AVIRIS hyperspectral dataset collected over Santa Barbara County, California. Both simulated and real hyperspectral target detection experiments show the proposed algorithms are effective at learning target signatures and performing target detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Greedy Multiple Instance Learning via Codebook Learning and Nearest Neighbor Voting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.0610v1)** | 2012-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has attracted great attention recently in machine learning community. However, most MIL algorithms are very slow and cannot be applied to large datasets. In this paper, we propose a greedy strategy to speed up the multiple instance learning process. Our contribution is two fold. First, we propose a density ratio model, and show that maximizing a density ratio function is the low bound of the DD model under certain conditions. Secondly, we make use of a histogram ratio between positive bags and negative bags to represent the density ratio function and find codebooks separately for positive bags and negative bags by a greedy strategy. For testing, we make use of a nearest neighbor strategy to classify new bags. We test our method on both small benchmark datasets and the large TRECVID MED11 dataset. The experimental results show that our method yields comparable accuracy to the current state of the art, while being up to at least one order of magnitude faster.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Learning with Sets in Multiple Instance Regression Applied to Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07745v3)** | 2020-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle the multiple instance regression (MIR) problem. This problem arises when the data is a collection of bags, where each bag is made of multiple instances corresponding to the same unique real-valued label. Our goal is to train a regression model which maps the instances of an unseen bag to its unique label. This MIR setting is common to remote sensing applications where there is high variability in the measurements and low geographical variability in the quantity being estimated. Our approach, in contrast to most competing methods, does not make the assumption that there exists a prime instance responsible for the label in each bag. Instead, we treat each bag as a set (i.e, an unordered sequence) of instances and learn to map each bag to its unique label by using all the instances in each bag. This is done by implementing an order-invariant operation characterized by a particular type of attention mechanism. This method is very flexible as it does not require domain knowledge nor does it make any assumptions about the distribution of the instances within each bag. We test our algorithm on five real world datasets and outperform previous state-of-the-art on three of the datasets. In addition, we augment our feature space by adding the moments of each feature for each bag, as extra features, and show that while the first moments lead to higher accuracy, there is a diminishing return.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2019, FEED Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Convex Formulation of Multiple Instance Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Bags](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.06767v3)** | 2018-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a variation of traditional supervised learning problems where data (referred to as bags) are composed of sub-elements (referred to as instances) and only bag labels are available. MIL has a variety of applications such as content-based image retrieval, text categorization and medical diagnosis. Most of the previous work for MIL assume that the training bags are fully labeled. However, it is often difficult to obtain an enough number of labeled bags in practical situations, while many unlabeled bags are available. A learning framework called PU learning (positive and unlabeled learning) can address this problem. In this paper, we propose a convex PU learning method to solve an MIL problem. We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves better performance with significantly lower computational costs than an existing method for PU-MIL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of COPD with Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04980v1)** | 2017-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease where early detection benefits the survival rate. COPD can be quantified by classifying patches of computed tomography images, and combining patch labels into an overall diagnosis for the image. As labeled patches are often not available, image labels are propagated to the patches, incorrectly labeling healthy patches in COPD patients as being affected by the disease. We approach quantification of COPD from lung images as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, which is more suitable for such weakly labeled data. We investigate various MIL assumptions in the context of COPD and show that although a concept region with COPD-related disease patterns is present, considering the whole distribution of lung tissue patches improves the performance. The best method is based on averaging instances and obtains an AUC of 0.742, which is higher than the previously reported best of 0.713 on the same dataset. Using the full training set further increases performance to 0.776, which is significantly higher (DeLong test) than previous results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2014</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning: Developing an Instance-Level Classifier via Weakly-Supervised Self-Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04813v1)** | 2024-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) problem is currently solved from either bag-classification or instance-classification perspective, both of which ignore important information contained in some instances and result in limited performance. For example, existing methods often face difficulty in learning hard positive instances. In this paper, we formulate MIL as a semi-supervised instance classification problem, so that all the labeled and unlabeled instances can be fully utilized to train a better classifier. The difficulty in this formulation is that all the labeled instances are negative in MIL, and traditional self-training techniques used in semi-supervised learning tend to degenerate in generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled instances in this scenario. To resolve this problem, we propose a weakly-supervised self-training method, in which we utilize the positive bag labels to construct a global constraint and a local constraint on the pseudo labels to prevent them from degenerating and force the classifier to learn hard positive instances. It is worth noting that easy positive instances are instances are far from the decision boundary in the classification process, while hard positive instances are those close to the decision boundary. Through iterative optimization, the pseudo labels can gradually approach the true labels. Extensive experiments on two MNIST synthetic datasets, five traditional MIL benchmark datasets and two histopathology whole slide image datasets show that our method achieved new SOTA performance on all of them. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

DL-FUMI estimates a "heartbeat concept" that represents an individual's personal ballistocardiogram heartbeat pattern. DL-FUMI formulates heartbeat detection and heartbeat characterization as a multiple instance learning problem to address the uncertainty inherent in aligning BCG signals with ground truth during training. Experimental results show that the estimated heartbeat concept found by DL-FUMI is an effective heartbeat prototype and achieves superior performance over comparison algorithms.</p></details> |  |

In blood cell disorders, only a subset of all cells is morphologically altered and relevant for the diagnosis. However, manually labeling of all cells is laborious, complicated and introduces inter-expert variability. We propose an attention based multiple instance learning method to classify blood samples of patients suffering from blood cell disorders. Cells are detected using an R-CNN architecture. With the features extracted for each cell, a multiple instance learning method classifies patient samples into one out of four blood cell disorders. The attention mechanism provides a measure of the contribution of each cell to the overall classification and significantly improves the network's classification accuracy as well as its interpretability for the medical expert.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15254v3)** | 2023-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The whole slide image (WSI) classification is often formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. Since the positive tissue is only a small fraction of the gigapixel WSI, existing MIL methods intuitively focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting hard-to-classify instances. Some literature has revealed that hard examples are beneficial for modeling a discriminative boundary accurately. By applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which uses a Siamese structure (Teacher-Student) with a consistency constraint to explore the potential hard instances. With several instance masking strategies based on attention scores, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model, which can be any attention-based MIL model. This counter-intuitive strategy essentially enables the student to learn a better discriminating boundary. Moreover, the student is used to update the teacher with an exponential moving average (EMA), which in turn identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes the optimization. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms other latest methods in terms of performance and training cost.

Accurate assessment of this risk is crucial to their course of care. We focus on estimating a patient's risk of cardiovascular death after an acute coronary syndrome based on a patient's raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Learning from this signal is challenging for two reasons: 1) positive examples signifying a downstream cardiovascular event are scarce, causing drastic class imbalance, and 2) each patient's ECG signal consists of thousands of heartbeats, accompanied by a single label for the downstream outcome. Machine learning has been previously applied to this task, but most approaches rely on hand-crafted features and domain knowledge. We propose a method that learns a representation from the raw ECG signal by using a multiple instance learning framework. We present a learned risk score for cardiovascular death that outperforms existing risk metrics in predicting cardiovascular death within 30, 60, 90, and 365 days on a dataset of 5000 patients.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference (MLHC 2019)</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we incorporate object segmentation into the detector training, which guides the model to correctly localize the full objects. We propose the multiple instance curriculum learning (MICL) method, which injects curriculum learning (CL) into the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework. The MICL method starts by automatically picking the easy training examples, where the extent of the segmentation masks agree with detection bounding boxes. The training set is gradually expanded to include harder examples to train strong detectors that handle complex images. The proposed MICL method with segmentation in the loop outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised object detectors by a substantial margin on the PASCAL VOC datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in BMVC 2017</p></details> |
| **[Multiple instance learning for sequence data with across bag dependencies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00163v2)** | 2020-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem for sequence data, the instances inside the bags are sequences. In some real world applications such as bioinformatics, comparing a random couple of sequences makes no sense. In fact, each instance may have structural and/or functional relations with instances of other bags. Thus, the classification task should take into account this across bag relation. In this work, we present two novel MIL approaches for sequence data classification named ABClass and ABSim. ABClass extracts motifs from related instances and use them to encode sequences. A discriminative classifier is then applied to compute a partial classification result for each set of related sequences. ABSim uses a similarity measure to discriminate the related instances and to compute a scores matrix. For both approaches, an aggregation method is applied in order to generate the final classification result. We applied both approaches to solve the problem of bacterial Ionizing Radiation Resistance prediction. The experimental results of the presented approaches are satisfactory.</p></details> |  |

WB-MRI is used to detect sites of disease across the entire skeletal system, but it requires significant expertise and is time-consuming to report due to the great number of images. To aid radiological reading, we propose an auxiliary task-based multiple instance learning approach (ATMIL) for MM classification with the ability to localize sites of disease. This approach is appealing as it only requires patient-level annotations where an attention mechanism is used to identify local regions with active disease. We borrow ideas from multi-task learning and define an auxiliary task with adaptive reweighting to support and improve learning efficiency in the presence of data scarcity. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real multi-center clinical data. We show that the MIL attention module provides a mechanism to localize bone regions while the adaptive reweighting of the auxiliary task considerably improves the performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2021</p></details> |
| **[SC-MIL: Sparsely Coded Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00048v2)** | 2024-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely used in weakly supervised whole slide image (WSI) classification. Typical MIL methods include a feature embedding part, which embeds the instances into features via a pre-trained feature extractor, and an MIL aggregator that combines instance embeddings into predictions. Most efforts have typically focused on improving these parts. This involves refining the feature embeddings through self-supervised pre-training as well as modeling the correlations between instances separately. In this paper, we proposed a sparsely coding MIL (SC-MIL) method that addresses those two aspects at the same time by leveraging sparse dictionary learning. The sparse dictionary learning captures the similarities of instances by expressing them as sparse linear combinations of atoms in an over-complete dictionary. In addition, imposing sparsity improves instance feature embeddings by suppressing irrelevant instances while retaining the most relevant ones. To make the conventional sparse coding algorithm compatible with deep learning, we unrolled it into a sparsely coded module leveraging deep unrolling. The proposed SC module can be incorporated into any existing MIL framework in a plug-and-play manner with an acceptable computational cost. The experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrated that the proposed SC module could substantially boost the performance of state-of-the-art MIL methods.

Computer-aided pathology to analyze microscopic histopathology images for diagnosis with an increasing number of breast cancer patients can bring the cost and delays of diagnosis down. Deep learning in histopathology has attracted attention over the last decade of achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and localization tasks. The convolutional neural network, a deep learning framework, provides remarkable results in tissue images analysis, but lacks in providing interpretation and reasoning behind the decisions. We aim to provide a better interpretation of classification results by providing localization on microscopic histopathology images. We frame the image classification problem as weakly supervised multiple instance learning problem where an image is collection of patches i.e. instances. Attention-based multiple instance learning (A-MIL) learns attention on the patches from the image to localize the malignant and normal regions in an image and use them to classify the image.

Two of the significant challenges in this task are variations in the scale and direction of the airplanes. To solve these challenges, we present a rotation-and-scale invariant airplane proposal generator. We call this generator symmetric line segments (SLS) that is developed based on the symmetric and regular boundaries of airplanes from the top view. Then, the generated proposals are used to train a deep convolutional neural network for removing non-airplane proposals. Since each airplane can have multiple SLS proposals, where some of them are not in the direction of the fuselage, we collect all proposals corresponding to one ground-truth as a positive bag and the others as the negative instances. To have multiple instance deep learning, we modify the loss function of the network to learn from each positive bag at least one instance as well as all negative instances. Finally, we employ non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections. Our experiments on NWPU VHR-10 and DOTA datasets show that our method is a promising approach for automatic airplane detection in very high-resolution images. Moreover, we estimate the direction of the airplanes using box-level annotations as an extra achievement.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Attention-Challenging Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07125v4)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the application of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, attention mechanisms often focus on a subset of discriminative instances, which are closely linked to overfitting. To mitigate overfitting, we present Attention-Challenging MIL (ACMIL). ACMIL combines two techniques based on separate analyses for attention value concentration. Firstly, UMAP of instance features reveals various patterns among discriminative instances, with existing attention mechanisms capturing only some of them. To remedy this, we introduce Multiple Branch Attention (MBA) to capture more discriminative instances using multiple attention branches. Secondly, the examination of the cumulative value of Top-K attention scores indicates that a tiny number of instances dominate the majority of attention. In response, we present Stochastic Top-K Instance Masking (STKIM), which masks out a portion of instances with Top-K attention values and allocates their attention values to the remaining instances. The extensive experimental results on three WSI datasets with two pre-trained backbones reveal that our ACMIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, through heatmap visualization and UMAP visualization, this paper extensively illustrates ACMIL's effectiveness in suppressing attention value concentration and overcoming the overfitting challenge.

It introduces similarities suitable for individual resource types that combined with an approximative clustering method efficiently group the system resources and define features directly from data. This approach effectively removes randomization often employed by malware authors and projects samples into low-dimensional feature space suitable for common classifiers. An extensive comparison to the state of the art on a large corpus of binaries demonstrates that the proposed solution achieves superior results using only a fraction of training samples. Moreover, it makes use of a source of information different than most of the prior art, which increases the diversity of tools detecting the malware, hence making detection evasion more difficult.</p></details> |  |

Current methods of visualisation-based malware classification largely rely on lossy transformations of inputs such as resizing to handle the large, variable-sized images. Through empirical analysis and experimentation, it is shown that these approaches cause crucial information loss that can be exploited. The proposed solution divides the images into patches and uses embedding-based multiple instance learning with a convolutional neural network and an attention aggregation function for classification. The implementation is evaluated on the Microsoft Malware Classification dataset and achieves accuracies of up to $96.6\%$ on adversarially enlarged samples compared to the baseline of $22.8\%$.

The existing aggregation strategy in MIL, which primarily relies on the first-order distance (e.g., mean difference) between instances, fails to accurately approximate the true feature distribution of each instance, leading to biased slide-level representations. Moreover, the scarcity of WSI observations easily leads to model overfitting, resulting in unstable testing performance and limited generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Bayesian nonparametric framework for multiple instance learning, which adopts a cascade of Dirichlet processes (cDP) to incorporate the instance-to-bag characteristic of the WSIs. We perform feature aggregation based on the latent clusters formed by the Dirichlet process, which incorporates the covariances of the patch features and forms more representative clusters. We then perform bag-level prediction with another Dirichlet process model on the bags, which imposes a natural regularization on learning to prevent overfitting and enhance generalizability. Moreover, as a Bayesian nonparametric method, the cDP model can accurately generate posterior uncertainty, which allows for the detection of outlier samples and tumor localization. Extensive experiments on five WSI benchmarks validate the superior performance of our method, as well as its generalizability and ability to estimate uncertainties.

In this work, we leverage Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to overcome this issue, and propose a new framework called MILLET: Multiple Instance Learning for Locally Explainable Time series classification. We apply MILLET to existing deep learning TSC models and show how they become inherently interpretable without compromising (and in some cases, even improving) predictive performance. We evaluate MILLET on 85 UCR TSC datasets and also present a novel synthetic dataset that is specially designed to facilitate interpretability evaluation. On these datasets, we show MILLET produces sparse explanations quickly that are of higher quality than other well-known interpretability methods.

However, due to their weak supervision nature, the MIL methods were susceptible to overfitting and required assistance in developing comprehensive representations of target instances. While regularization typically effectively combated overfitting, its integration with the MIL model has been frequently overlooked in prior studies. Meanwhile, current regularization methods for MIL have shown limitations in their capacity to uncover a diverse array of representations. In this study, we delve into the realm of regularization within the MIL model, presenting a novel approach in the form of a Progressive Dropout Layer (PDL). We aim to not only address overfitting but also empower the MIL model in uncovering intricate and impactful feature representations. The proposed method was orthogonal to existing MIL methods and could be easily integrated into them to boost performance. Our extensive evaluation across a range of MIL benchmark datasets demonstrated that the incorporation of the PDL into multiple MIL methods not only elevated their classification performance but also augmented their potential for weakly-supervised feature localizations.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available in https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/PDL</p></details> |
| **[Sharp Multiple Instance Learning for DeepFake Video Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04585v1)** | 2020-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of facial manipulation techniques, face forgery has received considerable attention in multimedia and computer vision community due to security concerns. Existing methods are mostly designed for single-frame detection trained with precise image-level labels or for video-level prediction by only modeling the inter-frame inconsistency, leaving potential high risks for DeepFake attackers. In this paper, we introduce a new problem of partial face attack in DeepFake video, where only video-level labels are provided but not all the faces in the fake videos are manipulated. We address this problem by multiple instance learning framework, treating faces and input video as instances and bag respectively. A sharp MIL (S-MIL) is proposed which builds direct mapping from instance embeddings to bag prediction, rather than from instance embeddings to instance prediction and then to bag prediction in traditional MIL. Theoretical analysis proves that the gradient vanishing in traditional MIL is relieved in S-MIL. To generate instances that can accurately incorporate the partially manipulated faces, spatial-temporal encoded instance is designed to fully model the intra-frame and inter-frame inconsistency, which further helps to promote the detection performance. We also construct a new dataset FFPMS for partially attacked DeepFake video detection, which can benefit the evaluation of different methods at both frame and video levels. Experiments on FFPMS and the widely used DFDC dataset verify that S-MIL is superior to other counterparts for partially attacked DeepFake video detection. In addition, S-MIL can also be adapted to traditional DeepFake image detection tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on single-frame datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MM 2020. 11 pages, 8 figures, with appendix</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the influences of financial news on the stock trends, from a multi-instance view. The intuition behind this is based on the news uncertainty of varying intervals of news occurrences and the lack of annotation in every single financial news. Under the scenario of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) where training instances are arranged in bags, and a label is assigned for the entire bag instead of instances, we develop a flexible and adaptive multi-instance learning model and evaluate its ability in directional movement forecast of Standard & Poors 500 index on financial news dataset. Specifically, we treat each trading day as one bag, with certain amounts of news happening on each trading day as instances in each bag. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed multi-instance-based framework gains outstanding results in terms of the accuracy of trend prediction, compared with other state-of-art approaches and baselines.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

| **[How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14783v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning: A Survey of Problem Characteristics and Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03365v1)** | 2022-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a form of weakly supervised learning where training instances are arranged in sets, called bags, and a label is provided for the entire bag. This formulation is gaining interest because it naturally fits various problems and allows to leverage weakly labeled data. Consequently, it has been used in diverse application fields such as computer vision and document classification. However, learning from bags raises important challenges that are unique to MIL. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the characteristics which define and differentiate the types of MIL problems. Until now, these problem characteristics have not been formally identified and described. As a result, the variations in performance of MIL algorithms from one data set to another are difficult to explain. In this paper, MIL problem characteristics are grouped into four broad categories: the composition of the bags, the types of data distribution, the ambiguity of instance labels, and the task to be performed. Methods specialized to address each category are reviewed. Then, the extent to which these characteristics manifest themselves in key MIL application areas are described. Finally, experiments are conducted to compare the performance of 16 state-of-the-art MIL methods on selected problem characteristics. This paper provides insight on how the problem characteristics affect MIL algorithms, recommendations for future benchmarking and promising avenues for research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Colorectal cancer survival prediction using deep distribution based multiple-instance learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.11294v2)** | 2022-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several deep learning algorithms have been developed to predict survival of cancer patients using whole slide images (WSIs).However, identification of image phenotypes within the WSIs that are relevant to patient survival and disease progression is difficult for both clinicians, and deep learning algorithms. Most deep learning based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms for survival prediction use either top instances (e.g., maxpooling) or top/bottom instances (e.g., MesoNet) to identify image phenotypes. In this study, we hypothesize that wholistic information of the distribution of the patch scores within a WSI can predict the cancer survival better. We developed a distribution based multiple-instance survival learning algorithm (DeepDisMISL) to validate this hypothesis. We designed and executed experiments using two large international colorectal cancer WSIs datasets - MCO CRC and TCGA COAD-READ. Our results suggest that the more information about the distribution of the patch scores for a WSI, the better is the prediction performance. Including multiple neighborhood instances around each selected distribution location (e.g., percentiles) could further improve the prediction. DeepDisMISL demonstrated superior predictive ability compared to other recently published, state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm is interpretable and could assist in understanding the relationship between cancer morphological phenotypes and patients cancer survival risk.</p></details> |  |

Without instance-level annotations, most existing methods follow the Segment-based Multiple Instance Learning (S-MIL) framework, where the predictions of segments are supervised by the labels of videos. However, the objective for acquiring segment-level scores during training is not consistent with the target for acquiring proposal-level scores during testing, leading to suboptimal results. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel Proposal-based Multiple Instance Learning (P-MIL) framework that directly classifies the candidate proposals in both the training and testing stages, which includes three key designs: 1) a surrounding contrastive feature extraction module to suppress the discriminative short proposals by considering the surrounding contrastive information, 2) a proposal completeness evaluation module to inhibit the low-quality proposals with the guidance of the completeness pseudo labels, and 3) an instance-level rank consistency loss to achieve robust detection by leveraging the complementarity of RGB and FLOW modalities. Extensive experimental results on two challenging benchmarks including THUMOS14 and ActivityNet demonstrate the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2023.

In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

In spite of the huge size of hole slide images, the number of individual slides is often rather small, leading to a small number of labeled samples. To improve training, we propose and investigate different data augmentation strategies for multiple instance learning based on the idea of linear interpolations of feature vectors (known as MixUp). Based on state-of-the-art multiple instance learning architectures and two thyroid cancer data sets, an exhaustive study is conducted considering a range of common data augmentation strategies. Whereas a strategy based on to the original MixUp approach showed decreases in accuracy, the use of a novel intra-slide interpolation method led to consistent increases in accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI'23, https://gitlab.com/mgadermayr/mixupmil</p></details> |

Machine learning problems in medical imaging often deal with rare diseases, making it important for these models to work in a label-imbalanced setting. In pathology images, there is another level of imbalance, where given a positively labeled Whole Slide Image (WSI), only a fraction of pixels within it contribute to the positive label. This compounds the severity of imbalance and makes imbalanced classification in pathology challenging. Furthermore, these imbalances can occur in out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets when the models are deployed in the real-world. We leverage the idea that decoupling feature and classifier learning can lead to improved decision boundaries for label imbalanced datasets. To this end, we investigate the integration of supervised contrastive learning with multiple instance learning (SC-MIL). Specifically, we propose a joint-training MIL framework in the presence of label imbalance that progressively transitions from learning bag-level representations to optimal classifier learning. We perform experiments with different imbalance settings for two well-studied problems in cancer pathology: subtyping of non-small cell lung cancer and subtyping of renal cell carcinoma. SC-MIL provides large and consistent improvements over other techniques on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD held-out sets across multiple imbalanced settings.</p></details> |  |

Most MIL methods operate at a single WSI magnification, by processing all the tissue patches. Such a formulation induces high computational requirements, and constrains the contextualization of the WSI-level representation to a single scale. A few MIL methods extend to multiple scales, but are computationally more demanding. In this paper, inspired by the pathological diagnostic process, we propose ZoomMIL, a method that learns to perform multi-level zooming in an end-to-end manner. ZoomMIL builds WSI representations by aggregating tissue-context information from multiple magnifications. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL methods in WSI classification on two large datasets, while significantly reducing the computational demands with regard to Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) and processing time by up to 40x.</p></details> | <details><summary>Typos...</summary><p>Typos corrected; Changed dataset name from INSEC to CRC upon dataset creators' request; Update affiliation and fix typos;</p></details> |

A new type of soft decision trees is considered, which is similar to the well-known soft oblique trees, but with a smaller number of trainable parameters. In order to train the trees, it is proposed to convert them into neural networks of a specific form, which approximate the tree functions. It is also proposed to aggregate the instance and bag embeddings (output vectors) by using the attention mechanism.

Instead of designing complex discriminative network architectures, we reveal that the inherent feature distribution of histopathological image data can serve as a very effective guide for instance classification. We propose a cluster-conditioned feature distribution modeling method and a pseudo label-based iterative feature space refinement strategy so that in the final feature space the positive and negative instances can be easily separated.

| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

| **[Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15138v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured State Space Models for Multiple Instance Learning in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15789v1)** | 2023-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning is an ideal mode of analysis for histopathology data, where vast whole slide images are typically annotated with a single global label. In such cases, a whole slide image is modelled as a collection of tissue patches to be aggregated and classified. Common models for performing this classification include recurrent neural networks and transformers. Although powerful compression algorithms, such as deep pre-trained neural networks, are used to reduce the dimensionality of each patch, the sequences arising from whole slide images remain excessively long, routinely containing tens of thousands of patches. Structured state space models are an emerging alternative for sequence modelling, specifically designed for the efficient modelling of long sequences. These models invoke an optimal projection of an input sequence into memory units that compress the entire sequence. In this paper, we propose the use of state space models as a multiple instance learner to a variety of problems in digital pathology. Across experiments in metastasis detection, cancer subtyping, mutation classification, and multitask learning, we demonstrate the competitiveness of this new class of models with existing state of the art approaches.

| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency.

Traditional MIL assumes that instances in each bag are independent samples from a given distribution. However, instances are often spatially or sequentially ordered, and one would expect similar diagnostic importance for neighboring instances. To address this, in this study, we propose a smooth attention deep MIL (SA-DMIL) model. Smoothness is achieved by the introduction of first and second order constraints on the latent function encoding the attention paid to each instance in a bag. The method is applied to the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT scans. The results show that this novel SA-DMIL: (a) achieves better performance than the non-smooth attention MIL at both scan (bag) and slice (instance) levels; (b) learns spatial dependencies between slices; and (c) outperforms current state-of-the-art MIL methods on the same ICH test set.</p></details> |  |

Our proposal is first to define the pseudo-closure operator (modeling the propagation concept) as a logical combination of neighborhoods. We show that learning such an operator lapses into the Multiple Instance (MI) framework, where the learning process is performed on bags of instances instead of individual instances. Though this framework is well suited for this task, its use for learning a pretopological space leads to a set of bags exponential in size. To overcome this issue we thus propose a learning method based on a low estimation of the bags covered by a concept under construction. As an experiment, percolation processes (forest fires typically) are simulated and the corresponding propagation models are learned based on a subset of observations. It reveals that the proposed MI approach is significantly more efficient on the task of propagation model recognition than existing methods.</p></details> | 36 pages 13 figures |
| **[Bag Graph: Multiple Instance Learning using Bayesian Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11132v1)** | 2022-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a weakly supervised learning problem where the aim is to assign labels to sets or bags of instances, as opposed to traditional supervised learning where each instance is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (IID) and is to be labeled individually. Recent work has shown promising results for neural network models in the MIL setting. Instead of focusing on each instance, these models are trained in an end-to-end fashion to learn effective bag-level representations by suitably combining permutation invariant pooling techniques with neural architectures. In this paper, we consider modelling the interactions between bags using a graph and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate end-to-end learning. Since a meaningful graph representing dependencies between bags is rarely available, we propose to use a Bayesian GNN framework that can generate a likely graph structure for scenarios where there is uncertainty in the graph or when no graph is available. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique for several MIL benchmark tasks and a distribution regression task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Multiple Instance Learning for Explainable Solar Flare Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13896v2)** | 2022-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we leverage a weakly-labeled dataset of spectral data from NASAs IRIS satellite for the prediction of solar flares using the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm. While standard supervised learning models expect a label for every instance, MIL relaxes this and only considers bags of instances to be labeled. This is ideally suited for flare prediction with IRIS data that consists of time series of bags of UV spectra measured along the instrument slit. In particular, we consider the readout window around the Mg II h&k lines that encodes information on the dynamics of the solar chromosphere. Our MIL models are not only able to predict whether flares occur within the next $\sim$25 minutes with accuracies of around 90%, but are also able to explain which spectral profiles were particularly important for their bag-level prediction. This information can be used to highlight regions of interest in ongoing IRIS observations in real-time and to identify candidates for typical flare precursor spectral profiles. We use k-means clustering to extract groups of spectral profiles that appear relevant for flare prediction. The recovered groups show high intensity, triplet red wing emission and single-peaked h and k lines, as found by previous works. They seem to be related to small-scale explosive events that have been reported to occur tens of minutes before a flare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation for Multiple Instance Learning-based Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03081v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedMIL: Federated-Multiple Instance Learning for Video Analysis with Optimized DPP Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17331v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many AI platforms, including traffic monitoring systems, use Federated Learning (FL) for decentralized sensor data processing for learning-based applications while preserving privacy and ensuring secured information transfer. On the other hand, applying supervised learning to large data samples, like high-resolution images requires intensive human labor to label different parts of a data sample. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) alleviates this challenge by operating over labels assigned to the 'bag' of instances. In this paper, we introduce Federated Multiple-Instance Learning (FedMIL). This framework applies federated learning to boost the training performance in video-based MIL tasks such as vehicle accident detection using distributed CCTV networks. However, data sources in decentralized settings are not typically Independently and Identically Distributed (IID), making client selection imperative to collectively represent the entire dataset with minimal clients. To address this challenge, we propose DPPQ, a framework based on the Determinantal Point Process (DPP) with a quality-based kernel to select clients with the most diverse datasets that achieve better performance compared to both random selection and current DPP-based client selection methods even with less data utilization in the majority of non-IID cases. This offers a significant advantage for deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources, providing a reliable solution for training AI models in massive smart sensor networks.</p></details> |  |

We learn such hash codes by aggregating deeply learnt hierarchical representations across bag members through a dedicated MI pool layer. For better trainability and retrieval quality, we propose a two-pronged approach that includes robust optimization and training with an auxiliary single instance hashing arm which is down-regulated gradually. We pose retrieval for tumor assessment as an MI problem because tumors often coexist with benign masses and could exhibit complementary signatures when scanned from different anatomical views. Experimental validations on benchmark mammography and histology datasets demonstrate improved retrieval performance over the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, under review at MICCAI 2017</p></details> |
| **[Multiplex-detection Based Multiple Instance Learning Network for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.03526v3)** | 2022-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a powerful approach to classify whole slide images (WSIs) for diagnostic pathology. A fundamental challenge of MIL on WSI classification is to discover the \textit{critical instances} that trigger the bag label. However, previous methods are primarily designed under the independent and identical distribution hypothesis (\textit{i.i.d}), ignoring either the correlations between instances or heterogeneity of tumours. In this paper, we propose a novel multiplex-detection-based multiple instance learning (MDMIL) to tackle the issues above. Specifically, MDMIL is constructed by the internal query generation module (IQGM) and the multiplex detection module (MDM) and assisted by the memory-based contrastive loss during training. Firstly, IQGM gives the probability of instances and generates the internal query (IQ) for the subsequent MDM by aggregating highly reliable features after the distribution analysis. Secondly, the multiplex-detection cross-attention (MDCA) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in MDM cooperate to generate the final representations for the WSI. In this process, the IQ and trainable variational query (VQ) successfully build up the connections between instances and significantly improve the model's robustness toward heterogeneous tumours. At last, to further enforce constraints in the feature space and stabilize the training process, we adopt a memory-based contrastive loss, which is practicable for WSI classification even with a single sample as input in each iteration. We conduct experiments on three computational pathology datasets, e.g., CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC datasets. The superior accuracy and AUC demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MDMIL over other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic smooth attention for deep multiple instance learning in medical imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14932v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Data Reveals Generalization Gaps in Correlated Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25759v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still do not achieve the best possible performance when trained with ten thousand training samples, each containing many instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention2Minority: A salient instance inference-based multiple instance learning for classifying small lesions in whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.07700v2)** | 2023-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) models have achieved remarkable success in analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) for disease classification problems. However, with regard to gigapixel WSI classification problems, current MIL models are often incapable of differentiating a WSI with extremely small tumor lesions. This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the attention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor tumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance inference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification. Our method initially learns representations of normal WSIs, and it then compares the normal WSIs representations with all the input patches to infer the salient instances of the input WSI. Finally, it employs attention-based MIL to perform the slide-level classification based on the selected patches of the WSI. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances, which could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to normal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times. It is worth mentioning that it performs equally well for large tumor lesions. As a result, SiiMIL achieves a significant improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art MIL methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Pathological Image Classification: An Instance Attribute Viewpoint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.00351v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a robust paradigm for whole-slide pathological image (WSI) analysis, processing gigapixel-resolution images with slide-level labels. As pioneering efforts, attention-based MIL (ABMIL) and its variants are increasingly becoming popular due to the characteristics of simultaneously handling clinical diagnosis and tumor localization. However, the attention mechanism exhibits limitations in discriminating between instances, which often misclassifies tissues and potentially impairs MIL performance. This paper proposes an Attribute-Driven MIL (AttriMIL) framework to address these issues. Concretely, we dissect the calculation process of ABMIL and present an attribute scoring mechanism that measures the contribution of each instance to bag prediction effectively, quantifying instance attributes. Based on attribute quantification, we develop a spatial attribute constraint and an attribute ranking constraint to model instance correlations within and across slides, respectively. These constraints encourage the network to capture the spatial correlation and semantic similarity of instances, improving the ability of AttriMIL to distinguish tissue types and identify challenging instances. Additionally, AttriMIL employs a histopathology adaptive backbone that maximizes the pre-trained model's feature extraction capability for collecting pathological features. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our AttriMIL outperforms existing state-of-the-art frameworks across multiple evaluation metrics. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MedCAI/AttriMIL.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

The results of this experiment suggest that our approach has potential application to productivity enhancement in assessment and to broader retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[C-MIL: Continuation Multiple Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05647v1)** | 2019-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) is a challenging task when provided with image category supervision but required to simultaneously learn object locations and object detectors. Many WSOD approaches adopt multiple instance learning (MIL) and have non-convex loss functions which are prone to get stuck into local minima (falsely localize object parts) while missing full object extent during training. In this paper, we introduce a continuation optimization method into MIL and thereby creating continuation multiple instance learning (C-MIL), with the intention of alleviating the non-convexity problem in a systematic way. We partition instances into spatially related and class related subsets, and approximate the original loss function with a series of smoothed loss functions defined within the subsets. Optimizing smoothed loss functions prevents the training procedure falling prematurely into local minima and facilitates the discovery of Stable Semantic Extremal Regions (SSERs) which indicate full object extent. On the PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets, C-MIL improves the state-of-the-art of weakly supervised object detection and weakly supervised object localization with large margins.</p></details> | Accept by CVPR2019 |
| **[AdvMIL: Adversarial Multiple Instance Learning for the Survival Analysis on Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06515v2)** | 2023-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The survival analysis on histological whole-slide images (WSIs) is one of the most important means to estimate patient prognosis. Although many weakly-supervised deep learning models have been developed for gigapixel WSIs, their potential is generally restricted by classical survival analysis rules and fully-supervised learning requirements. As a result, these models provide patients only with a completely-certain point estimation of time-to-event, and they could only learn from the labeled WSI data currently at a small scale. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel adversarial multiple instance learning (AdvMIL) framework. This framework is based on adversarial time-to-event modeling, and integrates the multiple instance learning (MIL) that is much necessary for WSI representation learning. It is a plug-and-play one, so that most existing MIL-based end-to-end methods can be easily upgraded by applying this framework, gaining the improved abilities of survival distribution estimation and semi-supervised learning. Our extensive experiments show that AdvMIL not only could often bring performance improvement to mainstream WSI survival analysis methods at a relatively low computational cost, but also enables these methods to effectively utilize unlabeled data via semi-supervised learning. Moreover, it is observed that AdvMIL could help improving the robustness of models against patch occlusion and two representative image noises. The proposed AdvMIL framework could promote the research of survival analysis in computational pathology with its novel adversarial MIL paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Particularly deep neural networks show high potential with respect to various tasks in the field of digital pathology. However, a limitation is given by the fact that typical deep learning algorithms require (manual) annotations in addition to the large amounts of image data, to enable effective training. Multiple instance learning exhibits a powerful tool for learning deep neural networks in a scenario without fully annotated data. These methods are particularly effective in this domain, due to the fact that labels for a complete whole slide image are often captured routinely, whereas labels for patches, regions or pixels are not. This potential already resulted in a considerable number of publications, with the majority published in the last three years. Besides the availability of data and a high motivation from the medical perspective, the availability of powerful graphics processing units exhibits an accelerator in this field. In this paper, we provide an overview of widely and effectively used concepts of used deep multiple instance learning approaches, recent advances and also critically discuss remaining challenges and future potential.</p></details> |  |

However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

However, target signature are often difficult or impossible to obtain. Furthermore, common methods for obtaining target signatures, such as from laboratory measurements or manual selection from an image scene, usually do not capture the discriminative features of target class. In this paper, an approach for estimating a discriminative target signature from imprecise labels is presented. The proposed approach maximizes the response of the hybrid sub-pixel detector within a multiple instance learning framework and estimates a set of discriminative target signatures. After learning target signatures, any signature based detector can then be applied on test data. Both simulated and real hyperspectral target detection experiments are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.</p></details> |  |

We propose a new method for aggregating predictions from smaller regions of the image into an image-level classification by using the quantile function. The quantile function provides a more complete description of the heterogeneity within each image, improving image-level classification. We also adapt image augmentation to the MI framework by randomly selecting cropped regions on which to apply MI aggregation during each epoch of training. This provides a mechanism to study the importance of MI learning. We validate our method on five different classification tasks for breast tumor histology and provide a visualization method for interpreting local image classifications that could lead to future insights into tumor heterogeneity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reproducibility in Multiple Instance Learning: A Case For Algorithmic Unit Tests](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17867v1)** | 2023-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a sub-domain of classification problems with positive and negative labels and a "bag" of inputs, where the label is positive if and only if a positive element is contained within the bag, and otherwise is negative. Training in this context requires associating the bag-wide label to instance-level information, and implicitly contains a causal assumption and asymmetry to the task (i.e., you can't swap the labels without changing the semantics). MIL problems occur in healthcare (one malignant cell indicates cancer), cyber security (one malicious executable makes an infected computer), and many other tasks. In this work, we examine five of the most prominent deep-MIL models and find that none of them respects the standard MIL assumption. They are able to learn anti-correlated instances, i.e., defaulting to "positive" labels until seeing a negative counter-example, which should not be possible for a correct MIL model. We suspect that enhancements and other works derived from these models will share the same issue. In any context in which these models are being used, this creates the potential for learning incorrect models, which creates risk of operational failure. We identify and demonstrate this problem via a proposed "algorithmic unit test", where we create synthetic datasets that can be solved by a MIL respecting model, and which clearly reveal learning that violates MIL assumptions. The five evaluated methods each fail one or more of these tests. This provides a model-agnostic way to identify violations of modeling assumptions, which we hope will be useful for future development and evaluation of MIL models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

While significant efforts have been devoted to OOD detection in classical supervised settings, the context of weakly supervised learning, particularly the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework, remains under-explored. In this study, we tackle this challenge by adapting post-hoc OOD detection methods to the MIL setting while introducing a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess OOD detection performance in weakly supervised scenarios. Across extensive experiments based on diverse public datasets, KNN emerges as the best-performing method overall. However, it exhibits significant shortcomings on some datasets, emphasizing the complexity of this under-explored and challenging topic. Our findings shed light on the complex nature of OOD detection under the MIL framework, emphasizing the importance of developing novel, robust, and reliable methods that can generalize effectively in a weakly supervised context.

Difficulty in visualization of the GB wall vessels may be due to the previous factors, potentially as a result of chronic inflammation or other diseases. In this paper we propose a multiple-instance learning (MIL) technique for assessment of the GB wall vascularity via computer-vision analysis of images from LC operations. The bags correspond to a labeled (low vs. high) vascularity dataset of 181 GB images, from 53 operations. The instances correspond to unlabeled patches extracted from these images. Each patch is represented by a vector with color, texture and statistical features. We compare various state-of-the-art MIL and single-instance learning approaches, as well as a proposed MIL technique based on variational Bayesian inference. The methods were compared for two experimental tasks: image-based and video-based (i.e. patient-based) classification. The proposed approach presents the best performance with accuracy 92.1% and 90.3% for the first and second task, respectively. A significant advantage of the proposed technique is that it does not require the time-consuming task of manual labelling the instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

Data annotation is an intensive human labor problem, particularly in sequential datasets, where the start and end time of anomalies are not known. As a result, data collected from sequential real-world processes can be largely unlabeled or contain inaccurate labels. These characteristics challenge the application of anomaly detection techniques based on supervised learning. In contrast, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been shown effective on problems with incomplete knowledge of labels in the training dataset, mainly due to the notion of bags. While largely under-leveraged for anomaly detection, MIL provides an appealing formulation for anomaly detection over real-world datasets, and it is the primary contribution of this paper. In this paper, we propose an MIL-based formulation and various algorithmic instantiations of this framework based on different design decisions for key components of the framework. We evaluate the resulting algorithms over four datasets that capture different physical processes along different modalities. The experimental evaluation draws out several observations. The MIL-based formulation performs no worse than single instance learning on easy to moderate datasets and outperforms single-instance learning on more challenging datasets. Altogether, the results show that the framework generalizes well over diverse datasets resulting from different real-world application domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,5 figures, Anomaly and Novelty Detection, Explanation and Accommodation (ANDEA 2022)</p></details> |

Medical applications often suffer from data scarcity and corruption by noise. Both of these problems are prominent in our data set. Furthermore, a varying number of spectra are available for the different patients. We address these issues by considering the task as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. Specifically, we aggregate multiple spectra from the same patient into a "bag" for classification and apply data augmentation techniques. To achieve the permutation invariance during the process of bagging, we proposed two approaches: (1) to apply min-, max-, and average-pooling on the features of all samples in one bag and (2) to apply an attention mechanism. We tested these two approaches on multiple neural network architectures. We demonstrate that classification performance is significantly improved when training on multiple instances rather than single spectra. We propose a simple oversampling data augmentation method and show that it could further improve the performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms manual classification by neuroradiologists according to most performance metrics.</p></details> |  |

| **[Weakly Supervised Vulnerability Localization via Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11312v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerability detection has emerged as a significant concern in the field of software security recently, capturing the attention of numerous researchers and developers. Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained vulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the developers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large volume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific vulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of vulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization usually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling vulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence, the demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at the statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via multiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level labels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a function is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the vulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically, inspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the ground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual statements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These pseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level representation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach achieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art performance in statement-level vulnerability localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09022v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight). 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[MiCo: Multiple Instance Learning with Context-Aware Clustering for Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18028v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Oral cancer detection and interpretation: Deep multiple instance learning versus conventional deep single instance learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01783v1)** | 2022-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current medical standard for setting an oral cancer (OC) diagnosis is histological examination of a tissue sample from the oral cavity. This process is time consuming and more invasive than an alternative approach of acquiring a brush sample followed by cytological analysis. Skilled cytotechnologists are able to detect changes due to malignancy, however, to introduce this approach into clinical routine is associated with challenges such as a lack of experts and labour-intensive work. To design a trustworthy OC detection system that would assist cytotechnologists, we are interested in AI-based methods that reliably can detect cancer given only per-patient labels (minimizing annotation bias), and also provide information on which cells are most relevant for the diagnosis (enabling supervision and understanding). We, therefore, perform a comparison of a conventional single instance learning (SIL) approach and a modern multiple instance learning (MIL) method suitable for OC detection and interpretation, utilizing three different neural network architectures. To facilitate systematic evaluation of the considered approaches, we introduce a synthetic PAP-QMNIST dataset, that serves as a model of OC data, while offering access to per-instance ground truth. Our study indicates that on PAP-QMNIST, the SIL performs better, on average, than the MIL approach. Performance at the bag level on real-world cytological data is similar for both methods, yet the single instance approach performs better on average. Visual examination by cytotechnologist indicates that the methods manage to identify cells which deviate from normality, including malignant cells as well as those suspicious for dysplasia. We share the code as open source at https://github.com/MIDA-group/OralCancerMILvsSIL</p></details> |  |
| **[MamMIL: Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images with State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05160v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pathological diagnosis has achieved superior performance by combining deep learning models with the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework using whole slide images (WSIs). However, the giga-pixeled nature of WSIs poses a great challenge for efficient MIL. Existing studies either do not consider global dependencies among instances, or use approximations such as linear attentions to model the pair-to-pair instance interactions, which inevitably brings performance bottlenecks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework named MamMIL for WSI analysis by cooperating the selective structured state space model (i.e., Mamba) with MIL, enabling the modeling of global instance dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. Specifically, considering the irregularity of the tissue regions in WSIs, we represent each WSI as an undirected graph. To address the problem that Mamba can only process 1D sequences, we further propose a topology-aware scanning mechanism to serialize the WSI graphs while preserving the topological relationships among the instances. Finally, in order to further perceive the topological structures among the instances and incorporate short-range feature interactions, we propose an instance aggregation block based on graph neural networks. Experiments show that MamMIL can achieve advanced performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks.

| **[Self-Supervision Enhances Instance-based Multiple Instance Learning Methods in Digital Pathology: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01109v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as the best solution for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging (SPIE)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Multiple Instance Learning with Distance-Aware Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10552v2)** | 2023-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional supervised learning tasks require a label for every instance in the training set, but in many real-world applications, labels are only available for collections (bags) of instances. This problem setting, known as multiple instance learning (MIL), is particularly relevant in the medical domain, where high-resolution images are split into smaller patches, but labels apply to the image as a whole. Recent MIL models are able to capture correspondences between patches by employing self-attention, allowing them to weigh each patch differently based on all other patches in the bag. However, these approaches still do not consider the relative spatial relationships between patches within the larger image, which is especially important in computational pathology. To this end, we introduce a novel MIL model with distance-aware self-attention (DAS-MIL), which explicitly takes into account relative spatial information when modelling the interactions between patches. Unlike existing relative position representations for self-attention which are discrete, our approach introduces continuous distance-dependent terms into the computation of the attention weights, and is the first to apply relative position representations in the context of MIL. We evaluate our model on a custom MNIST-based MIL dataset that requires the consideration of relative spatial information, as well as on CAMELYON16, a publicly available cancer metastasis detection dataset, where we achieve a test AUROC score of 0.91. On both datasets, our model outperforms existing MIL approaches that employ absolute positional encodings, as well as existing relative position representation schemes applied to MIL. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/das-mil.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Adaptive Multiple Instance Learning for Instance-level Prediction of Pathological Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03537v1)** | 2023-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological image analysis is an important process for detecting abnormalities such as cancer from cell images. However, since the image size is generally very large, the cost of providing detailed annotations is high, which makes it difficult to apply machine learning techniques. One way to improve the performance of identifying abnormalities while keeping the annotation cost low is to use only labels for each slide, or to use information from another dataset that has already been labeled. However, such weak supervisory information often does not provide sufficient performance. In this paper, we proposed a new task setting to improve the classification performance of the target dataset without increasing annotation costs. And to solve this problem, we propose a pipeline that uses multiple instance learning (MIL) and domain adaptation (DA) methods. Furthermore, in order to combine the supervisory information of both methods effectively, we propose a method to create pseudo-labels with high confidence. We conducted experiments on the pathological image dataset we created for this study and showed that the proposed method significantly improves the classification performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISBI 2023 (Oral).

| **[Rethinking Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification: A Bag-Level Classifier is a Good Instance-Level Teacher](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01099v1)** | 2023-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has demonstrated promise in Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, a major challenge persists due to the high computational cost associated with processing these gigapixel images. Existing methods generally adopt a two-stage approach, comprising a non-learnable feature embedding stage and a classifier training stage. Though it can greatly reduce the memory consumption by using a fixed feature embedder pre-trained on other domains, such scheme also results in a disparity between the two stages, leading to suboptimal classification accuracy. To address this issue, we propose that a bag-level classifier can be a good instance-level teacher. Based on this idea, we design Iteratively Coupled Multiple Instance Learning (ICMIL) to couple the embedder and the bag classifier at a low cost. ICMIL initially fix the patch embedder to train the bag classifier, followed by fixing the bag classifier to fine-tune the patch embedder. The refined embedder can then generate better representations in return, leading to a more accurate classifier for the next iteration. To realize more flexible and more effective embedder fine-tuning, we also introduce a teacher-student framework to efficiently distill the category knowledge in the bag classifier to help the instance-level embedder fine-tuning. Thorough experiments were conducted on four distinct datasets to validate the effectiveness of ICMIL. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of existing MIL backbones, achieving state-of-the-art results.

| **[Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Zero-shot Image Tagging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06051v1)** | 2018-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-line with the success of deep learning on traditional recognition problem, several end-to-end deep models for zero-shot recognition have been proposed in the literature. These models are successful to predict a single unseen label given an input image, but does not scale to cases where multiple unseen objects are present. In this paper, we model this problem within the framework of Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first end-to-end trainable deep MIL framework for the multi-label zero-shot tagging problem. Due to its novel design, the proposed framework has several interesting features: (1) Unlike previous deep MIL models, it does not use any off-line procedure (e.g., Selective Search or EdgeBoxes) for bag generation. (2) During test time, it can process any number of unseen labels given their semantic embedding vectors. (3) Using only seen labels per image as weak annotation, it can produce a bounding box for each predicted labels. We experiment with the NUS-WIDE dataset and achieve superior performance across conventional, zero-shot and generalized zero-shot tagging tasks.</p></details> |  |

The development of weakly supervised segmentation algorithm alleviates the problem of medical image annotation that it is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As a subset of weakly supervised learning, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been proven to be effective in segmentation. However, there is a lack of related information between instances in MIL, which limits the further improvement of segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised method for pixel-level segmentation in histopathology images, which introduces Transformer into the MIL framework to capture global or long-range dependencies. The multi-head self-attention in the Transformer establishes the relationship between instances, which solves the shortcoming that instances are independent of each other in MIL. In addition, deep supervision is introduced to overcome the limitation of annotations in weakly supervised methods and make the better utilization of hierarchical information. The state-of-the-art results on the colon cancer dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with other weakly supervised methods. It is worth believing that there is a potential of our approach for various applications in medical images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Provi...</summary><p>Provisional accepted for MICCAI 2022</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Attention based on Gaussian Processes for Deep Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04061v1)** | 2023-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a weakly supervised learning paradigm that is becoming increasingly popular because it requires less labeling effort than fully supervised methods. This is especially interesting for areas where the creation of large annotated datasets remains challenging, as in medicine. Although recent deep learning MIL approaches have obtained state-of-the-art results, they are fully deterministic and do not provide uncertainty estimations for the predictions. In this work, we introduce the Attention Gaussian Process (AGP) model, a novel probabilistic attention mechanism based on Gaussian Processes for deep MIL. AGP provides accurate bag-level predictions as well as instance-level explainability, and can be trained end-to-end. Moreover, its probabilistic nature guarantees robustness to overfitting on small datasets and uncertainty estimations for the predictions. The latter is especially important in medical applications, where decisions have a direct impact on the patient's health. The proposed model is validated experimentally as follows. First, its behavior is illustrated in two synthetic MIL experiments based on the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Then, it is evaluated in three different real-world cancer detection experiments. AGP outperforms state-of-the-art MIL approaches, including deterministic deep learning ones. It shows a strong performance even on a small dataset with less than 100 labels and generalizes better than competing methods on an external test set. Moreover, we experimentally show that predictive uncertainty correlates with the risk of wrong predictions, and therefore it is a good indicator of reliability in practice. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2023 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

| **[CARMIL: Context-Aware Regularization on Multiple Instance Learning models for Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00427v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have proven effective for cancer prognosis from Whole Slide Images. However, the original MIL formulation incorrectly assumes the patches of the same image to be independent, leading to a loss of spatial context as information flows through the network. Incorporating contextual knowledge into predictions is particularly important given the inclination for cancerous cells to form clusters and the presence of spatial indicators for tumors. State-of-the-art methods often use attention mechanisms eventually combined with graphs to capture spatial knowledge. In this paper, we take a novel and transversal approach, addressing this issue through the lens of regularization. We propose Context-Aware Regularization for Multiple Instance Learning (CARMIL), a versatile regularization scheme designed to seamlessly integrate spatial knowledge into any MIL model. Additionally, we present a new and generic metric to quantify the Context-Awareness of any MIL model when applied to Whole Slide Images, resolving a previously unexplored gap in the field. The efficacy of our framework is evaluated for two survival analysis tasks on glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) and colon cancer data (TCGA COAD).</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Continual Learning for Whole Slide Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10649v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, most MIL approaches do not exploit the interdependencies of tiles extracted from a whole slide image, which could provide valuable cues for classification. This paper presents a novel MIL approach that exploits the spatial relationship of tiles for classifying whole slide images. To do so, a sparse map is built from tiles embeddings, and is then classified by a sparse-input CNN. It obtained state-of-the-art performance over popular MIL approaches on the classification of cancer subtype involving 10000 whole slide images. Our results suggest that the proposed approach might (i) improve the representation learning of instances and (ii) exploit the context of instance embeddings to enhance the classification performance.

| **[RoFormer for Position Aware Multiple Instance Learning in Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01924v1)** | 2023-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a critical task in computational pathology. However, the gigapixel-size of such images remains a major challenge for the current state of deep-learning. Current methods rely on multiple-instance learning (MIL) models with frozen feature extractors. Given the the high number of instances in each image, MIL methods have long assumed independence and permutation-invariance of patches, disregarding the tissue structure and correlation between patches. Recent works started studying this correlation between instances but the computational workload of such a high number of tokens remained a limiting factor. In particular, relative position of patches remains unaddressed. We propose to apply a straightforward encoding module, namely a RoFormer layer , relying on memory-efficient exact self-attention and relative positional encoding. This module can perform full self-attention with relative position encoding on patches of large and arbitrary shaped WSIs, solving the need for correlation between instances and spatial modeling of tissues. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MIL models on three commonly used public datasets (TCGA-NSCLC, BRACS and Camelyon16)) on weakly supervised classification tasks.

However, existing MIL methods predominantly focus on single-task learning, resulting in not only overall low efficiency but also the overlook of inter-task relatedness. To address these issues, we proposed an adapted architecture of Multi-gate Mixture-of-experts with Multi-proxy for Multiple instance learning (M4), and applied this framework for simultaneous prediction of multiple genetic mutations from WSIs. The proposed M4 model has two main innovations: (1) utilizing a mixture of experts with multiple gating strategies for multi-genetic mutation prediction on a single pathological slide; (2) constructing multi-proxy expert network and gate network for comprehensive and effective modeling of pathological image information. Our model achieved significant improvements across five tested TCGA datasets in comparison to current state-of-the-art single-task methods.

The holy grail of such approaches is the free-living scenario, in which data are collected continuously and unobtrusively during every day life. However, obtaining fine-grained ground-truth and remaining unobtrusive is a contradiction and therefore, the problem is usually addressed via multiple-instance learning. Yet for large scale studies, obtaining even the necessary coarse ground-truth is not trivial, as a complete neurological evaluation is required. In contrast, large scale collection of data without any ground-truth is much easier. Nevertheless, utilizing unlabelled data in a multiple-instance setting is not straightforward, as the topic has received very little research attention. Here we try to fill this gap by introducing a new method for combining semi-supervised with multiple-instance learning. Our approach builds on the Virtual Adversarial Training principle, a state-of-the-art approach for regular semi-supervised learning, which we adapt and modify appropriately for the multiple-instance setting. We first establish the validity of the proposed approach through proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic problems generated from two well-known benchmark datasets. We then move on to the actual task of detecting PD tremor from hand acceleration signals collected in-the-wild, but in the presence of additional completely unlabelled data. We show that by leveraging the unlabelled data of 454 subjects we can achieve large performance gains (up to 9% increase in F1-score) in per-subject tremor detection for a cohort of 45 subjects with known tremor ground-truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>A.

We proposed a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which were processed by LLMs to infer multiple distortion instances, each with a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and LLM-inferred salience scores improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity.

Moreover, since the structure frequently carries a semantic meaning, reflecting it in the machine learning model should improve the accuracy but more importantly it facilitates the explanation of decisions and the model. This paper demonstrates on the identification of infected computers in the computer network from their HTTP traffic, how to achieve this reflection using recent progress in multiple-instance learning. The proposed model is compared to complementary approaches from the prior art, the first relying on human-designed features and the second on automatically learned features through convolution neural networks. In a challenging scenario measuring accuracy only on unseen domains/malware families, the proposed model is superior to the prior art while providing a valuable feedback to the security researchers. We believe that the proposed framework will found applications elsewhere even beyond the field of security.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically rely on pre-trained models from large natural image datasets, such as ImageNet, to generate instance features, which can be sub-optimal due to the significant differences between natural images and histopathology images that lead to a domain shift. In this paper, we present a novel, simple yet effective method for learning domain-specific knowledge transformation from pre-trained models to histopathology images. Our approach entails using a prompt component to assist the pre-trained model in discerning differences between the pre-trained dataset and the target histopathology dataset, resulting in improved performance of MIL models. We validate our method on two publicly available datasets, Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our method for different MIL models and backbones.

Due to the high resolution of the WSI and the unavailability of patch-level annotations, WSI classification is usually formulated as a weakly supervised problem, which relies on multiple instance learning (MIL) based on patches of a WSI. In this paper, we aim to learn an optimal patch-level feature space by integrating prototype learning with MIL. To this end, we develop a Trainable Prototype enhanced deep MIL (TPMIL) framework for weakly supervised WSI classification. In contrast to the conventional methods which rely on a certain number of selected patches for feature space refinement, we softly cluster all the instances by allocating them to their corresponding prototypes. Additionally, our method is able to reveal the correlations between different tumor subtypes through distances between corresponding trained prototypes. More importantly, TPMIL also enables to provide a more accurate interpretability based on the distance of the instances from the trained prototypes which serves as an alternative to the conventional attention score-based interpretability.

| **[Food Image Classification and Segmentation with Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11452v1)** | 2023-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for accurate food quantification has increased in the recent years, driven by the needs of applications in dietary monitoring. At the same time, computer vision approaches have exhibited great potential in automating tasks within the food domain. Traditionally, the development of machine learning models for these problems relies on training data sets with pixel-level class annotations. However, this approach introduces challenges arising from data collection and ground truth generation that quickly become costly and error-prone since they must be performed in multiple settings and for thousands of classes. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents a weakly supervised methodology for training food image classification and semantic segmentation models without relying on pixel-level annotations. The proposed methodology is based on a multiple instance learning approach in combination with an attention-based mechanism. At test time, the models are used for classification and, concurrently, the attention mechanism generates semantic heat maps which are used for food class segmentation. In the paper, we conduct experiments on two meta-classes within the FoodSeg103 data set to verify the feasibility of the proposed approach and we explore the functioning properties of the attention mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at 18th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization (SMAP 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Detector Discovery in the Wild: Joint Multiple Instance and Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1135v1)** | 2017-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop methods for detector learning which exploit joint training over both weak and strong labels and which transfer learned perceptual representations from strongly-labeled auxiliary tasks. Previous methods for weak-label learning often learn detector models independently using latent variable optimization, but fail to share deep representation knowledge across classes and usually require strong initialization. Other previous methods transfer deep representations from domains with strong labels to those with only weak labels, but do not optimize over individual latent boxes, and thus may miss specific salient structures for a particular category. We propose a model that subsumes these previous approaches, and simultaneously trains a representation and detectors for categories with either weak or strong labels present. We provide a novel formulation of a joint multiple instance learning method that includes examples from classification-style data when available, and also performs domain transfer learning to improve the underlying detector representation. Our model outperforms known methods on ImageNet-200 detection with weak labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approaching Maximal Information Extraction in Low-Signal Regimes via Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07114v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher Information latent in a dataset.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the chest CT is regarded as a popular and informative imaging tool for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, we observe that there are two issues -- weak annotation and insufficient data that may obstruct automatic COVID-19 severity assessment with CT images. To address these challenges, we propose a novel three-component method, i.e., 1) a deep multiple instance learning component with instance-level attention to jointly classify the bag and also weigh the instances, 2) a bag-level data augmentation component to generate virtual bags by reorganizing high confidential instances, and 3) a self-supervised pretext component to aid the learning process. We have systematically evaluated our method on the CT images of 229 COVID-19 cases, including 50 severe and 179 non-severe cases. Our method could obtain an average accuracy of 95.8%, with 93.6% sensitivity and 96.4% specificity, which outperformed previous works.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |

Diseases like Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) pose challenges due to scarce and costly annotations on a single-cell level. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) addresses weakly labeled scenarios but necessitates powerful encoders typically trained with labeled data. In this study, we explore Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a pre-training approach for MIL-based AML subtype classification from blood smears, removing the need for labeled data during encoder training. We investigate the three state-of-the-art SSL methods SimCLR, SwAV, and DINO, and compare their performance against supervised pre-training. Our findings show that SSL-pretrained encoders achieve comparable performance, showcasing the potential of SSL in MIL. This breakthrough offers a cost-effective and data-efficient solution, propelling the field of AI-based disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGR-MIL: Exploring Diverse Global Representation in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03575v1)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) stands as a powerful approach in weakly supervised learning, regularly employed in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification for detecting tumorous lesions. However, existing mainstream MIL methods focus on modeling correlation between instances while overlooking the inherent diversity among instances. However, few MIL methods have aimed at diversity modeling, which empirically show inferior performance but with a high computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel MIL aggregation method based on diverse global representation (DGR-MIL), by modeling diversity among instances through a set of global vectors that serve as a summary of all instances. First, we turn the instance correlation into the similarity between instance embeddings and the predefined global vectors through a cross-attention mechanism. This stems from the fact that similar instance embeddings typically would result in a higher correlation with a certain global vector. Second, we propose two mechanisms to enforce the diversity among the global vectors to be more descriptive of the entire bag: (i) positive instance alignment and (ii) a novel, efficient, and theoretically guaranteed diversification learning paradigm. Specifically, the positive instance alignment module encourages the global vectors to align with the center of positive instances (e.g., instances containing tumors in WSI). To further diversify the global representations, we propose a novel diversification learning paradigm leveraging the determinantal point process. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art MIL aggregation models by a substantial margin on the CAMELYON-16 and the TCGA-lung cancer datasets.

| **[Learning Pain from Action Unit Combinations: A Weakly Supervised Approach via Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01496v2)** | 2018-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patient pain can be detected highly reliably from facial expressions using a set of facial muscle-based action units (AUs) defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). A key characteristic of facial expression of pain is the simultaneous occurrence of pain-related AU combinations, whose automated detection would be highly beneficial for efficient and practical pain monitoring. Existing general Automated Facial Expression Recognition (AFER) systems prove inadequate when applied specifically for detecting pain as they either focus on detecting individual pain-related AUs but not on combinations or they seek to bypass AU detection by training a binary pain classifier directly on pain intensity data but are limited by lack of enough labeled data for satisfactory training. In this paper, we propose a new approach that mimics the strategy of human coders of decoupling pain detection into two consecutive tasks: one performed at the individual video-frame level and the other at video-sequence level. Using state-of-the-art AFER tools to detect single AUs at the frame level, we propose two novel data structures to encode AU combinations from single AU scores. Two weakly supervised learning frameworks namely multiple instance learning (MIL) and multiple clustered instance learning (MCIL) are employed corresponding to each data structure to learn pain from video sequences. Experimental results show an 87% pain recognition accuracy with 0.94 AUC (Area Under Curve) on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression dataset. Tests on long videos in a lung cancer patient video dataset demonstrates the potential value of the proposed system for pain monitoring in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning with Vision-Language Models for Incremental Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10573v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, e.g., tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four public WSI datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

State of the art methods rely on hand-crafted annotations which hinder clinical translation since histology suffers from significant variations between cancer phenotypes.

In particular, we exploit a multiple instance learning scheme for training models. The proposed framework has been evaluated on multi-locations and multi-centric public data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the PatchCamelyon dataset. Promising results when compared with experts' annotations demonstrate the potentials of the presented approach.

| **[Multi-Class Multiple Instance Learning for Predicting Precursors to Aviation Safety Events](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06244v1)** | 2021-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the application of machine learning techniques that leverage aviation data collected from commercial airline operations to improve safety. Anomaly detection and predictive maintenance have been the main targets for machine learning applications. However, this paper focuses on the identification of precursors, which is a relatively newer application. Precursors are events correlated with adverse events that happen prior to the adverse event itself. Therefore, precursor mining provides many benefits including understanding the reasons behind a safety incident and the ability to identify signatures, which can be tracked throughout a flight to alert the operators of the potential for an adverse event in the future. This work proposes using the multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework, a weakly supervised learning task, combined with carefully designed binary classifier leveraging a Multi-Head Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network (MHCNN-RNN) architecture. Multi-class classifiers are then created and compared, enabling the prediction of different adverse events for any given flight by combining binary classifiers, and by modifying the MHCNN-RNN to handle multiple outputs. Results obtained showed that the multiple binary classifiers perform better and are able to accurately forecast high speed and high path angle events during the approach phase. Multiple binary classifiers are also capable of determining the aircraft's parameters that are correlated to these events. The identified parameters can be considered precursors to the events and may be studied/tracked further to prevent these events in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 15 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Existing CP datasets focus on narrow tasks; ARCH on the other hand contains dense diagnostic and morphological descriptions for a range of stains, tissue types and pathologies. Using intrinsic dimensionality estimation, we show that ARCH is the only CP dataset to (ARCH-)rival its computer vision analog MS-COCO Captions. We conjecture that an encoder pre-trained on dense image captions learns transferable representations for most CP tasks. We support the conjecture with evidence that ARCH representation transfers to a variety of pathology sub-tasks better than ImageNet features or representations obtained via self-supervised or multi-task learning on pathology images alone. We release our best model and invite other researchers to test it on their CP tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2021</p></details> |
| **[Diagnose Like a Pathologist: Transformer-Enabled Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08125v2)** | 2023-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and transformers are increasingly popular in histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, unlike human pathologists who selectively observe specific regions of histopathology tissues under different magnifications, most methods do not incorporate multiple resolutions of the WSIs, hierarchically and attentively, thereby leading to a loss of focus on the WSIs and information from other resolutions. To resolve this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning framework to fully exploit the WSIs. This framework can dynamically and attentively discover the discriminative regions across multiple resolutions of the WSIs. Within this framework, an Integrated Attention Transformer is proposed to further enhance the performance of the transformer and obtain a more holistic WSI (bag) representation. This transformer consists of multiple Integrated Attention Modules, which is the combination of a transformer layer and an aggregation module that produces a bag representation based on every instance representation in that bag. The experimental results show that our method achieved state-of-the-art performances on multiple datasets, including Camelyon16, TCGA-RCC, TCGA-NSCLC, and an in-house IMGC dataset.

Because it can be expensive to obtain strong labeling that specifies the starting and ending times of the events, modern systems are often trained with weak labeling without explicit timing information. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular framework for learning from weak labeling. In a common scenario of MIL, it is necessary to choose a pooling function to aggregate the predictions for the individual steps of the sequences. In this paper, we compare the "max" and "noisy-or" pooling functions on a speech recognition task and a sound event detection task. We find that max pooling is able to localize phonemes and sound events, while noisy-or pooling fails. We provide a theoretical explanation of the different behavior of the two pooling functions on sequence learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Set2Seq Transformer: Temporal and Positional-Aware Set Representations for Sequential Multiple-Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03404v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential multiple-instance learning involves learning representations of sets distributed across discrete timesteps. In many real-world applications, modeling both the internal structure of sets and their temporal relationships across time is essential for capturing complex underlying patterns. However, existing methods either focus on learning set representations at a static level, ignoring temporal dynamics, or treat sequences as ordered lists of individual elements, lacking explicit mechanisms to represent sets. In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. We will release both the dataset and model implementations on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Transfer Learning and Multiple Instance Learning for HER2 Automatic Scoring of H\&E Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05028v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker in breast cancer patients who can benefit from cost-effective automatic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) HER2 scoring. However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Attention Modeling for Categorical Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06667v1)** | 2020-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Categorical speech emotion recognition is typically performed as a sequence-to-label problem, i.e., to determine the discrete emotion label of the input utterance as a whole. One of the main challenges in practice is that most of the existing emotion corpora do not give ground truth labels for each segment; instead, we only have labels for whole utterances. To extract segment-level emotional information from such weakly labeled emotion corpora, we propose using multiple instance learning (MIL) to learn segment embeddings in a weakly supervised manner. Also, for a sufficiently long utterance, not all of the segments contain relevant emotional information. In this regard, three attention-based neural network models are then applied to the learned segment embeddings to attend the most salient part of a speech utterance. Experiments on the CASIA corpus and the IEMOCAP database show better or highly competitive results than other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

The cheating behavior detection model in examination invigilation systems plays a pivotal role in guaranteeing the equality of long-distance examinations. However, cheating behavior is rare, and most researchers do not comprehensively take into account features such as head posture, gaze angle, body posture, and background information in the task of cheating behavior detection. In this paper, we develop and present CHEESE, a CHEating detection framework via multiplE inStancE learning. The framework consists of a label generator that implements weak supervision and a feature encoder to learn discriminative features. In addition, the framework combines body posture and background features extracted by 3D convolution with eye gaze, head posture and facial features captured by OpenFace 2.0. These features are fed into the spatio-temporal graph module by stitching to analyze the spatio-temporal changes in video clips to detect the cheating behaviors. Our experiments on three datasets, UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech and Online Exam Proctoring (OEP), prove the effectiveness of our method as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, and obtain the frame-level AUC score of 87.58% on the OEP dataset.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

We show how RM can be approached as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where trajectories are treated as bags with return labels, and steps within the trajectories are instances with unseen reward labels. We go on to develop new MIL models that are able to capture the time dependencies in labelled trajectories. We demonstrate on a range of RL tasks that our novel MIL models can reconstruct reward functions to a high level of accuracy, and can be used to train high-performing agent policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages (10 main content; 2 references; 1 checklist; 14 appendix). 14 figures (9 main content; 5 appendix).

Despite its promising benefits, questions concerning performance trends for varying sample sizes and its influence on model interpretability remain. Addressing these, we reach an optimal performance enhancement of 1.7% using thirty percent of patches on the CAMELYON16 dataset, and 3.7% with only eight samples on the TUPAC16 dataset. We also find interpretability effects are strongly dataset-dependent, with interpretability impacted on CAMELYON16, while remaining unaffected on TUPAC16. This reinforces that both the performance and interpretability relationships with sampling are closely task-specific. End-to-end training with 1024 samples reveals improvements across both datasets compared to pre-extracted features, further highlighting the potential of this efficient approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>SPIE ...</summary><p>SPIE Medical Imaging 2024</p></details> |

However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

| **[Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning: Refining Coarse Annotations on Single Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10778v2)** | 2022-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotating cancerous regions in whole-slide images (WSIs) of pathology samples plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, biomedical research, and machine learning algorithms development. However, generating exhaustive and accurate annotations is labor-intensive, challenging, and costly. Drawing only coarse and approximate annotations is a much easier task, less costly, and it alleviates pathologists' workload. In this paper, we study the problem of refining these approximate annotations in digital pathology to obtain more accurate ones. Some previous works have explored obtaining machine learning models from these inaccurate annotations, but few of them tackle the refinement problem where the mislabeled regions should be explicitly identified and corrected, and all of them require a -- often very large -- number of training samples. We present a method, named Label Cleaning Multiple Instance Learning (LC-MIL), to refine coarse annotations on a single WSI without the need of external training data. Patches cropped from a WSI with inaccurate labels are processed jointly within a multiple instance learning framework, mitigating their impact on the predictive model and refining the segmentation. Our experiments on a heterogeneous WSI set with breast cancer lymph node metastasis, liver cancer, and colorectal cancer samples show that LC-MIL significantly refines the coarse annotations, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives, even while learning from a single slide. Moreover, we demonstrate how real annotations drawn by pathologists can be efficiently refined and improved by the proposed approach. All these results demonstrate that LC-MIL is a promising, light-weight tool to provide fine-grained annotations from coarsely annotated pathology sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Priority-Aware Clinical Pathology Hierarchy Training for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20469v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios. Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with multiple symptoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for oral presentation by The 2nd MICCAI Student Board (MSB) EMERGE Workshop</p></details> |

However, the current MIL methods are usually based on independent and identical distribution hypothesis, thus neglect the correlation among different instances. To address this problem, we proposed a new framework, called correlated MIL, and provided a proof for convergence. Based on this framework, we devised a Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), which explored both morphological and spatial information. The proposed TransMIL can effectively deal with unbalanced/balanced and binary/multiple classification with great visualization and interpretability. We conducted various experiments for three different computational pathology problems and achieved better performance and faster convergence compared with state-of-the-art methods. The test AUC for the binary tumor classification can be up to 93.09% over CAMELYON16 dataset. And the AUC over the cancer subtypes classification can be up to 96.03% and 98.82% over TCGA-NSCLC dataset and TCGA-RCC dataset, respectively.

We introduce DSMIL-LocNet, a Multiple Instance Learning framework for whale call detection and localization using only bag-level labels. Our dual-stream model processes 2-30 minute audio segments, leveraging spectral and temporal features with attention-based instance selection. Tests on Antarctic whale data show longer contexts improve classification (F1: 0.8-0.9) while medium instances ensure localization precision (0.65-0.70). This suggests MIL can enhance scalable marine monitoring. Code: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/DSMIL-Loc</p></details> |  |
| **[Key Patches Are All You Need: A Multiple Instance Learning Framework For Robust Medical Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01654v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have revolutionized the field of medical image analysis, due to their outstanding performances. However, they are sensitive to spurious correlations, often taking advantage of dataset bias to improve results for in-domain data, but jeopardizing their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose to limit the amount of information these models use to reach the final classification, by using a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework. MIL forces the model to use only a (small) subset of patches in the image, identifying discriminative regions. This mimics the clinical procedures, where medical decisions are based on localized findings. We evaluate our framework on two medical applications: skin cancer diagnosis using dermoscopy and breast cancer diagnosis using mammography. Our results show that using only a subset of the patches does not compromise diagnostic performance for in-domain data, compared to the baseline approaches. However, our approach is more robust to shifts in patient demographics, while also providing more detailed explanations about which regions contributed to the decision.

| **[Feature Re-calibration based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.10878v2)** | 2022-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) classification is a fundamental task for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases; but, curation of accurate labels is time-consuming and limits the application of fully-supervised methods. To address this, multiple instance learning (MIL) is a popular method that poses classification as a weakly supervised learning task with slide-level labels only. While current MIL methods apply variants of the attention mechanism to re-weight instance features with stronger models, scant attention is paid to the properties of the data distribution. In this work, we propose to re-calibrate the distribution of a WSI bag (instances) by using the statistics of the max-instance (critical) feature. We assume that in binary MIL, positive bags have larger feature magnitudes than negatives, thus we can enforce the model to maximize the discrepancy between bags with a metric feature loss that models positive bags as out-of-distribution. To achieve this, unlike existing MIL methods that use single-batch training modes, we propose balanced-batch sampling to effectively use the feature loss i.e., (+/-) bags simultaneously. Further, we employ a position encoding module (PEM) to model spatial/morphological information, and perform pooling by multi-head self-attention (PSMA) with a Transformer encoder. Experimental results on existing benchmark datasets show our approach is effective and improves over state-of-the-art MIL methods.</p></details> | MICCAI 2022 |
| **[Unbiased Multiple Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12369v1)** | 2023-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) is challenging because the binary anomaly label is only given on the video level, but the output requires snippet-level predictions. So, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is prevailing in WSVAD. However, MIL is notoriously known to suffer from many false alarms because the snippet-level detector is easily biased towards the abnormal snippets with simple context, confused by the normality with the same bias, and missing the anomaly with a different pattern. To this end, we propose a new MIL framework: Unbiased MIL (UMIL), to learn unbiased anomaly features that improve WSVAD. At each MIL training iteration, we use the current detector to divide the samples into two groups with different context biases: the most confident abnormal/normal snippets and the rest ambiguous ones. Then, by seeking the invariant features across the two sample groups, we can remove the variant context biases. Extensive experiments on benchmarks UCF-Crime and TAD demonstrate the effectiveness of our UMIL. Our code is provided at https://github.com/ktr-hubrt/UMIL.</p></details> | 11 pages,10 figures |

Applying CNNs to microscopy images is challenging due to the lack of datasets labeled at the single cell level. We extend the application of CNNs to microscopy image classification and segmentation using multiple instance learning (MIL). We present the adaptive Noisy-AND MIL pooling function, a new MIL operator that is robust to outliers. Combining CNNs with MIL enables training CNNs using full resolution microscopy images with global labels. We base our approach on the similarity between the aggregation function used in MIL and pooling layers used in CNNs. We show that training MIL CNNs end-to-end outperforms several previous methods on both mammalian and yeast microscopy images without requiring any segmentation steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extracting 2D weak labels from volume labels using multiple instance learning in CT hemorrhage detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05650v1)** | 2019-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a supervised learning methodology that aims to allow models to learn instance class labels from bag class labels, where a bag is defined to contain multiple instances. MIL is gaining traction for learning from weak labels but has not been widely applied to 3D medical imaging. MIL is well-suited to clinical CT acquisitions since (1) the highly anisotropic voxels hinder application of traditional 3D networks and (2) patch-based networks have limited ability to learn whole volume labels. In this work, we apply MIL with a deep convolutional neural network to identify whether clinical CT head image volumes possess one or more large hemorrhages (> 20cm$^3$), resulting in a learned 2D model without the need for 2D slice annotations. Individual image volumes are considered separate bags, and the slices in each volume are instances. Such a framework sets the stage for incorporating information obtained in clinical reports to help train a 2D segmentation approach. Within this context, we evaluate the data requirements to enable generalization of MIL by varying the amount of training data. Our results show that a training size of at least 400 patient image volumes was needed to achieve accurate per-slice hemorrhage detection. Over a five-fold cross-validation, the leading model, which made use of the maximum number of training volumes, had an average true positive rate of 98.10%, an average true negative rate of 99.36%, and an average precision of 0.9698. The models have been made available along with source code to enabled continued exploration and adaption of MIL in CT neuroimaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topologically Regularized Multiple Instance Learning to Harness Data Scarcity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14025v2)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In biomedical data analysis, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models have emerged as a powerful tool to classify patients' microscopy samples. However, the data-intensive requirement of these models poses a significant challenge in scenarios with scarce data availability, e.g., in rare diseases. We introduce a topological regularization term to MIL to mitigate this challenge. It provides a shape-preserving inductive bias that compels the encoder to maintain the essential geometrical-topological structure of input bags during projection into latent space. This enhances the performance and generalization of the MIL classifier regardless of the aggregation function, particularly for scarce training data. The effectiveness of our method is confirmed through experiments across a range of datasets, showing an average enhancement of 2.8% for MIL benchmarks, 15.3% for synthetic MIL datasets, and 5.5% for real-world biomedical datasets over the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them. The results showed improvements in one of the three multi-scale approaches, while the others led to decreased scores. This provides motivation for analysis and discussion of the individual approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at IPTA 2022 (Best Paper) edit: During work on this publication Maximilian Ernst Tschuchnig was affiliated with Salzburg University of Applied Sciences and University of Salzburg</p></details> |

Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective, motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50 features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE = 10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> |
| **[A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06769v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning (DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, accepted conference paper at SPIE REMOTE SENSING, 3-7 September 2023, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[Terabyte-scale Deep Multiple Instance Learning for Classification and Localization in Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06983v2)** | 2018-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of computational pathology, the use of decision support systems powered by state-of-the-art deep learning solutions has been hampered by the lack of large labeled datasets. Until recently, studies relied on datasets in the order of few hundreds of slides which are not enough to train a model that can work at scale in the clinic. Here, we have gathered a dataset consisting of 12,160 slides, two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets in pathology and equivalent to 25 times the pixel count of the entire ImageNet dataset. Given the size of our dataset it is possible for us to train a deep learning model under the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) assumption where only the overall slide diagnosis is necessary for training, avoiding all the expensive pixel-wise annotations that are usually part of supervised learning approaches. We test our framework on a complex task, that of prostate cancer diagnosis on needle biopsies. We performed a thorough evaluation of the performance of our MIL pipeline under several conditions achieving an AUC of 0.98 on a held-out test set of 1,824 slides. These results open the way for training accurate diagnosis prediction models at scale, laying the foundation for decision support system deployment in the clinic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Additive MIL: Intrinsically Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01794v2)** | 2022-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely applied in pathology towards solving critical problems such as automating cancer diagnosis and grading, predicting patient prognosis, and therapy response. Deploying these models in a clinical setting requires careful inspection of these black boxes during development and deployment to identify failures and maintain physician trust. In this work, we propose a simple formulation of MIL models, which enables interpretability while maintaining similar predictive performance. Our Additive MIL models enable spatial credit assignment such that the contribution of each region in the image can be exactly computed and visualized. We show that our spatial credit assignment coincides with regions used by pathologists during diagnosis and improves upon classical attention heatmaps from attention MIL models. We show that any existing MIL model can be made additive with a simple change in function composition. We also show how these models can debug model failures, identify spurious features, and highlight class-wise regions of interest, enabling their use in high-stakes environments such as clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViLa-MIL: Dual-scale Vision-Language Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08391v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based framework has become the mainstream for processing the whole slide image (WSI) with giga-pixel size and hierarchical image context in digital pathology. However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> |

Existing approaches that use machine learning with Earth observation data for LCC rely on fully-annotated and segmented datasets. Creating these datasets requires a large amount of effort, and a lack of suitable datasets has become an obstacle in scaling the use of LCC. In this study, we propose Scene-to-Patch models: an alternative LCC approach utilising Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) that requires only high-level scene labels. This enables much faster development of new datasets whilst still providing segmentation through patch-level predictions, ultimately increasing the accessibility of using LCC for different scenarios. On the DeepGlobe-LCC dataset, our approach outperforms non-MIL baselines on both scene- and patch-level prediction. This work provides the foundation for expanding the use of LCC in climate change mitigation methods for technology, government, and academia.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages total (4 main content; 2 acknowledgments + citations; 8 appendices); 8 figures (2 main; 6 appendix); published at "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Workshop at NeurIPS 2022"</p></details> |

So the purpose of this paper is to achieve manifold action instances localization in a lengthy untrimmed query video using limited trimmed support videos. To address this challenging problem effectively, we proposed a novel solution involving a spatial-channel relation transformer with probability learning and cluster refinement. This method can accurately identify the start and end boundaries of actions in the query video, utilizing only a limited number of labeled videos. Our proposed method is adept at capturing both temporal and spatial contexts to effectively classify and precisely locate actions in videos, enabling a more comprehensive utilization of these crucial details. The selective cosine penalization algorithm is designed to suppress temporal boundaries that do not include action scene switches. The probability learning combined with the label generation algorithm alleviates the problem of action duration diversity and enhances the model's ability to handle fuzzy action boundaries. The interval cluster can help us get the final results with multiple instances situations in few-shot temporal action localization. Our model achieves competitive performance through meticulous experimentation utilizing the benchmark datasets ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14.

However, aligning WSIs with diagnostic captions presents a significant challenge. This difficulty arises from two main factors: 1) Gigapixel WSIs are unsuitable for direct input into deep learning models, and the redundancy and correlation among the patches demand more attention; and 2) Authentic WSI diagnostic captions are extremely limited, making it difficult to train an effective model. To overcome these obstacles, we present PathM3, a multimodal, multi-task, multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for WSI classification and captioning. PathM3 adapts a query-based transformer to effectively align WSIs with diagnostic captions. Given that histopathology visual patterns are redundantly distributed across WSIs, we aggregate each patch feature with MIL method that considers the correlations among instances. Furthermore, our PathM3 overcomes data scarcity in WSI-level captions by leveraging limited WSI diagnostic caption data in the manner of multi-task joint learning. Extensive experiments with improved classification accuracy and caption generation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both WSI classification and captioning task.</p></details> |  |

Second, it is amenable to learning from segmentation labels to guide training. In contrast to existing methods, the human user can faithfully interpret predictions and interact with the model to decide which regions to attend to. Experiments are conducted on a large clinical dataset of $\sim$38k bitewings ($\sim$316k teeth), where we achieve competitive performance compared to various baselines.

| **[Milmer: a Framework for Multiple Instance Learning based Multimodal Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00547v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotions play a crucial role in human behavior and decision-making, making emotion recognition a key area of interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). This study addresses the challenges of emotion recognition by integrating facial expression analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, introducing a novel multimodal framework-Milmer. The proposed framework employs a transformer-based fusion approach to effectively integrate visual and physiological modalities. It consists of an EEG preprocessing module, a facial feature extraction and balancing module, and a cross-modal fusion module. To enhance visual feature extraction, we fine-tune a pre-trained Swin Transformer on emotion-related datasets. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism is introduced to balance token representation across modalities, ensuring effective feature integration. A key innovation of this work is the adoption of a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, which extracts meaningful information from multiple facial expression images over time, capturing critical temporal dynamics often overlooked in previous studies. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.72% in the four-class emotion recognition task. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each module, highlighting the significance of advanced feature extraction and fusion strategies in enhancing emotion recognition performance.

The extremely high resolution and limited availability of region-level annotations make employing deep learning methods for WSI-based digital diagnosis challenging. Recently integrating multiple instance learning (MIL) and Transformer for WSI analysis shows very promising results. However, designing effective Transformers for this weakly-supervised high-resolution image analysis is an underexplored yet important problem. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level MIL (MMIL) scheme by introducing a hierarchical structure to MIL, which enables efficient handling of MIL tasks involving a large number of instances. Based on MMIL, we instantiated MMIL-Transformer, an efficient Transformer model with windowed exact self-attention for large-scale MIL tasks. To validate its effectiveness, we conducted a set of experiments on WSI classification tasks, where MMIL-Transformer demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, i.e., 96.80% test AUC and 97.67% test accuracy on the CAMELYON16 dataset, 99.04% test AUC and 94.37% test accuracy on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset, respectively.

For object recog- nition, CNNs might be limited by its strict label requirement and an implicit assumption that images are supposed to be target- object-dominated for optimal solutions. However, the labeling procedure, necessitating laying out the locations of target ob- jects, is very tedious, making high-quality large-scale dataset prohibitively expensive. Data augmentation schemes are widely used when deep networks suffer the insufficient training data problem. All the images produced through data augmentation share the same label, which may be problematic since not all data augmentation methods are label-preserving. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised CNN framework named Multiple Instance Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (MILCNN) to solve this problem. We apply MILCNN framework to object recognition and report state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ILSVRC2015 classification dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Pattern Recognition(ICPR) 2016, Oral paper</p></details> |

Most of the time, only slide-level label is available because pixel-wise annotation is labour intensive task. In this paper, we propose a deep learning pipeline for classification in histology images. Using multiple instance learning, we attempt to predict the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) status of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) based on haematoxylin and eosin-stain (H&E) histology images. We utilised attention mechanism with residual connection for our aggregation layers. In our 3-fold cross-validation experiment, we achieved average accuracy, AUC and F1-score 0.936, 0.995 and 0.862, respectively. This method also allows us to examine the model interpretability by visualising attention scores.

Yet the decent performance of deep learning comes from harnessing massive datasets and diverse samples, urging the need for efficient training pipelines for scaling to large datasets and data augmentation techniques for diversifying samples. However, current MIL-based WSI classification pipelines are memory-expensive and computation-inefficient since they usually assemble tens of thousands of patches as bags for computation. On the other hand, despite their popularity in other tasks, data augmentations are unexplored for WSI MIL frameworks. To address them, we propose ReMix, a general and efficient framework for MIL based WSI classification. It comprises two steps: reduce and mix. First, it reduces the number of instances in WSI bags by substituting instances with instance prototypes, i.e., patch cluster centroids. Then, we propose a ``Mix-the-bag'' augmentation that contains four online, stochastic and flexible latent space augmentations. It brings diverse and reliable class-identity-preserving semantic changes in the latent space while enforcing semantic-perturbation invariance. We evaluate ReMix on two public datasets with two state-of-the-art MIL methods. In our experiments, consistent improvements in precision, accuracy, and recall have been achieved but with orders of magnitude reduced training time and memory consumption, demonstrating ReMix's effectiveness and efficiency.

| **[Robust compressive tracking via online weighted multiple instance learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09914v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing a robust object tracker is a challenging task due to factors such as occlusion, motion blur, fast motion, illumination variations, rotation, background clutter, low resolution and deformation across the frames. In the literature, lots of good approaches based on sparse representation have already been presented to tackle the above problems. However, most of the algorithms do not focus on the learning of sparse representation. They only consider the modeling of target appearance and therefore drift away from the target with the imprecise training samples. By considering all the above factors in mind, we have proposed a visual object tracking algorithm by integrating a coarse-to-fine search strategy based on sparse representation and the weighted multiple instance learning (WMIL) algorithm. Compared with the other trackers, our approach has more information of the original signal with less complexity due to the coarse-to-fine search method, and also has weights for important samples. Thus, it can easily discriminate the background features from the foreground. Furthermore, we have also selected the samples from the un-occluded sub-regions to efficiently develop the strong classifier. As a consequence, a stable and robust object tracker is achieved to tackle all the aforementioned problems. Experimental results with quantitative as well as qualitative analysis on challenging benchmark datasets show the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Multiple Instance Learning for Weakly Supervised Person ReID](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07685v1)** | 2024-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The acquisition of large-scale, precisely labeled datasets for person re-identification (ReID) poses a significant challenge. Weakly supervised ReID has begun to address this issue, although its performance lags behind fully supervised methods. In response, we introduce Contrastive Multiple Instance Learning (CMIL), a novel framework tailored for more effective weakly supervised ReID. CMIL distinguishes itself by requiring only a single model and no pseudo labels while leveraging contrastive losses -- a technique that has significantly enhanced traditional ReID performance yet is absent in all prior MIL-based approaches. Through extensive experiments and analysis across three datasets, CMIL not only matches state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale SYSU-30k dataset with fewer assumptions but also consistently outperforms all baselines on the WL-market1501 and Weakly Labeled MUddy racer re-iDentification dataset (WL-MUDD) datasets. We introduce and release the WL-MUDD dataset, an extension of the MUDD dataset featuring naturally occurring weak labels from the real-world application at PerformancePhoto.co.

Recent studies have shown Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework is useful for histopathological images when no annotations are available in classification task. Different to the current image-based survival models that limit to key patches or clusters derived from Whole Slide Images (WSIs), we propose Deep Attention Multiple Instance Survival Learning (DeepAttnMISL) by introducing both siamese MI-FCN and attention-based MIL pooling to efficiently learn imaging features from the WSI and then aggregate WSI-level information to patient-level. Attention-based aggregation is more flexible and adaptive than aggregation techniques in recent survival models. We evaluated our methods on two large cancer whole slide images datasets and our results suggest that the proposed approach is more effective and suitable for large datasets and has better interpretability in locating important patterns and features that contribute to accurate cancer survival predictions. The proposed framework can also be used to assess individual patient's risk and thus assisting in delivering personalized medicine. Codes are available at https://github.com/uta-smile/DeepAttnMISL_MEDIA.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 13 figures, published in Medical Image Analysis 65, 101789</p></details> |

| **[Automatic Classification of Pathology Reports using TF-IDF Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07406v1)** | 2019-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Pathology report is arguably one of the most important documents in medicine containing interpretive information about the visual findings from the patient's biopsy sample. Each pathology report has a retention period of up to 20 years after the treatment of a patient. Cancer registries process and encode high volumes of free-text pathology reports for surveillance of cancer and tumor diseases all across the world. In spite of their extremely valuable information they hold, pathology reports are not used in any systematic way to facilitate computational pathology. Therefore, in this study, we investigate automated machine-learning techniques to identify/predict the primary diagnosis (based on ICD-O code) from pathology reports. We performed experiments by extracting the TF-IDF features from the reports and classifying them using three different methods---SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. We constructed a new dataset with 1,949 pathology reports arranged into 37 ICD-O categories, collected from four different primary sites, namely lung, kidney, thymus, and testis. The reports were manually transcribed into text format after collecting them as PDF files from NCI Genomic Data Commons public dataset. We subsequently pre-processed the reports by removing irrelevant textual artifacts produced by OCR software. The highest classification accuracy we achieved was 92\% using XGBoost classifier on TF-IDF feature vectors, the linear SVM scored 87\% accuracy. Furthermore, the study shows that TF-IDF vectors are suitable for highlighting the important keywords within a report which can be helpful for the cancer research and diagnostic workflow. The results are encouraging in demonstrating the potential of machine learning methods for classification and encoding of pathology reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[WsiCaption: Multiple Instance Generation of Pathology Reports for Gigapixel Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16480v4)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images are the foundation of digital pathology for the diagnosis and treatment of carcinomas. Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving pathology reports using business intelligence techniques: An experimental study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03550v1)** | 2016-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health professionals use pathology reports to monitor and manage a patient's health. Typically, pathologists diagnose patients' conditions and produce these reports which are then used as reference by clinicians and eventually shared with the patient. Pathology reports are difficult to interpret as the reports are written using complex medical terminology. As patients only see their doctors for a limited time, the complexity of report content and the manner in which the information is presented in the reports may hinder patients' understanding of their medical condition and prognosis. The objective of this study was to compare patient comprehension of results from two pathology-reporting styles: the traditional format in current widespread use and new style developed using techniques common in business intelligence system (BI) development. The study found that the reports prepared using a "BI style" improve experimental subject's understanding and satisfaction with the reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>ISBN#...</summary><p>ISBN# 978-0-646-95337-3 Presented at the Australasian Conference on Information Systems 2015 (arXiv:1605.01032)</p></details> |
| **[Human-centric Metric for Accelerating Pathology Reports Annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.01226v2)** | 2019-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology reports contain useful information such as the main involved organ, diagnosis, etc. These information can be identified from the free text reports and used for large-scale statistical analysis or serve as annotation for other modalities such as pathology slides images. However, manual classification for a huge number of reports on multiple tasks is labor-intensive. In this paper, we have developed an automatic text classifier based on BERT and we propose a human-centric metric to evaluate the model. According to the model confidence, we identify low-confidence cases that require further expert annotation and high-confidence cases that are automatically classified. We report the percentage of low-confidence cases and the performance of automatically classified cases. On the high-confidence cases, the model achieves classification accuracy comparable to pathologists. This leads a potential of reducing 80% to 98% of the manual annotation workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) at NeurIPS 2019 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Pathology Report Generation and Multimodal Representation Learning for Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19293v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of melanocytic skin lesions are examined by pathologists each year, the majority of which concern common nevi (i.e., ordinary moles). While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |
| **[Large Multimodal Model based Standardisation of Pathology Reports with Confidence and their Prognostic Significance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02040v1)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology reports are rich in clinical and pathological details but are often presented in free-text format. The unstructured nature of these reports presents a significant challenge limiting the accessibility of their content. In this work, we present a practical approach based on the use of large multimodal models (LMMs) for automatically extracting information from scanned images of pathology reports with the goal of generating a standardised report specifying the value of different fields along with estimated confidence about the accuracy of the extracted fields. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods which do not assign confidence scores to extracted fields limiting their practical use. The proposed framework uses two stages of prompting a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for information extraction and validation. The framework generalises to textual reports from multiple medical centres as well as scanned images of legacy pathology reports. We show that the estimated confidence is an effective indicator of the accuracy of the extracted information that can be used to select only accurately extracted fields. We also show the prognostic significance of structured and unstructured data from pathology reports and show that the automatically extracted field values significant prognostic value for patient stratification. The framework is available for evaluation via the URL: https://labieb.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Anatomy-Guided Radiology Report Generation with Pathology-Aware Regional Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10789v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to enhance radiology practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Navigating the reporting guideline environment for computational pathology: A review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09985v1)** | 2023-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of new artificial intelligence (AI) discoveries is transforming healthcare research. However, the standards of reporting are variable in this still evolving field, leading to potential research waste. The aim of this work is to highlight resources and reporting guidelines available to researchers working in computational pathology. The EQUATOR Network library of reporting guidelines and extensions was systematically searched up to August 2022 to identify applicable resources. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used and guidance was screened for utility at different stages of research and for a range of study types. Items were compiled to create a summary for easy identification of useful resources and guidance. Over 70 published resources applicable to pathology AI research were identified. Guidelines were divided into key categories, reflecting current study types and target areas for AI research: Literature & Research Priorities, Discovery, Clinical Trial, Implementation and Post-Implementation & Guidelines. Guidelines useful at multiple stages of research and those currently in development were also highlighted. Summary tables with links to guidelines for these groups were developed, to assist those working in cancer AI research with complete reporting of research. Issues with replication and research waste are recognised problems in AI research. Reporting guidelines can be used as templates to ensure the essential information needed to replicate research is included within journal articles and abstracts. Reporting guidelines are available and useful for many study types, but greater awareness is needed to encourage researchers to utilise them and for journals to adopt them. This review and summary of resources highlights guidance to researchers, aiming to improve completeness of reporting.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

| **[Hierarchical Deep Learning Classification of Unstructured Pathology Reports to Automate ICD-O Morphology Grading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.00542v1)** | 2020-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely cancer reporting data are required in order to understand the impact of cancer, inform public health resource planning and implement cancer policy especially in Sub Saharan Africa where the reporting lag is behind world averages. Unstructured pathology reports, which contain tumor specific data, are the main source of information collected by cancer registries. Due to manual processing and labelling of pathology reports using the International Classification of Disease for oncology (ICD-O) codes, by human coders employed by cancer registries, has led to a considerable lag in cancer reporting. We present a hierarchical deep learning classification method that employs convolutional neural network models to automate the classification of 1813 anonymized breast cancer pathology reports with applicable ICD-O morphology codes across 9 classes. We demonstrate that the hierarchical deep learning classification method improves on performance in comparison to a flat multiclass CNN model for ICD-O morphology classification of the same reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Workshop at NeurIPS 2018 arXiv:1811.07216. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2008.12571</p></details> |
| **[Pathology Extraction from Chest X-Ray Radiology Reports: A Performance Study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02305v1)** | 2018-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extraction of relevant pathological terms from radiology reports is important for correct image label generation and disease population studies. In this letter, we compare the performance of some known application program interface (APIs) for the task of thoracic abnormality extraction from radiology reports. We explored several medical domain specific annotation tools like Medical Text Indexer(MTI) with Non-MEDLINE and Mesh On Demand(MOD) options and generic Natural Language Understanding (NLU) API provided by the IBM cloud. Our results show that although MTI and MOD are intended for extracting medical terms, their performance is worst compared to generic extraction API like IBM NLU. Finally, we trained a DNN-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract the key concept words from radiology reports. Our model outperforms the medical specific and generic API performance by a large margin. Our results demonstrate the inadequacy of generic APIs for pathology extraction task and establish the importance of domain specific model training for improved results. We hope that these results motivate the research community to release larger de-identified radiology reports corpus for building high accuracy machine learning models for the important task of pathology extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cancer Type, Stage and Prognosis Assessment from Pathology Reports using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01194v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise across various natural language processing tasks. However, their application in the field of pathology, particularly for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured medical texts such as pathology reports, remains underexplored and not well quantified. In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art language models, including the GPT family, Mistral models, and the open-source Llama models, to evaluate their performance in comprehensively analyzing pathology reports. Specifically, we assess their performance in cancer type identification, AJCC stage determination, and prognosis assessment, encompassing both information extraction and higher-order reasoning tasks. Based on a detailed analysis of their performance metrics in a zero-shot setting, we developed two instruction-tuned models: Path-llama3.1-8B and Path-GPT-4o-mini-FT. These models demonstrated superior performance in zero-shot cancer type identification, staging, and prognosis assessment compared to the other models evaluated.</p></details> |  |
| **[See Detail Say Clear: Towards Brain CT Report Generation via Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19676v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain CT report generation is significant to aid physicians in diagnosing cranial diseases. Recent studies concentrate on handling the consistency between visual and textual pathological features to improve the coherence of report. However, there exist some challenges: 1) Redundant visual representing: Massive irrelevant areas in 3D scans distract models from representing salient visual contexts. 2) Shifted semantic representing: Limited medical corpus causes difficulties for models to transfer the learned textual representations to generative layers. This study introduces a Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning (PCRL) model to build cross-modal representations based on pathological clues and naturally adapt them for accurate report generation. Specifically, we construct pathological clues from perspectives of segmented regions, pathological entities, and report themes, to fully grasp visual pathological patterns and learn cross-modal feature representations. To adapt the representations for the text generation task, we bridge the gap between representation learning and report generation by using a unified large language model (LLM) with task-tailored instructions. These crafted instructions enable the LLM to be flexibly fine-tuned across tasks and smoothly transfer the semantic representation for report generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves SoTA performance.

| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

The annotation is extensive for the large volume of cancer pathology reports the registry receives annually from public and private sector institutions. This manual process, coupled with other challenges results in a significant 4-year lag in reporting of annual cancer statistics in South Africa. We present a hierarchical deep learning ensemble method incorporating state of the art convolutional neural network models for the automatic labelling of 2201 de-identified, free text pathology reports, with appropriate ICD-O breast cancer topography codes across 8 classes. Our results show an improvement in primary site classification over the state of the art CNN model by greater than 14% for F1 micro and 55% for F1 macro scores. We demonstrate that the hierarchical deep learning ensemble improves on state-of-the-art models for ICD-O topography classification in comparison to a flat multiclass model for predicting ICD-O topography codes for pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD workshop on Machine Learning for Medicine and Healthcare, August 2018, London UK</p></details> |
| **[Use of natural language processing to extract and classify papillary thyroid cancer features from surgical pathology reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00015v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background We aim to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction and classification of thyroid cancer risk factors from pathology reports. Methods We analyzed 1,410 surgical pathology reports from adult papillary thyroid cancer patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 2010 to 2019. Structured and non-structured reports were used to create a consensus-based ground truth dictionary and categorized them into modified recurrence risk levels. Non-structured reports were narrative, while structured reports followed standardized formats. We then developed ThyroPath, a rule-based NLP pipeline, to extract and classify thyroid cancer features into risk categories. Training involved 225 reports (150 structured, 75 unstructured), with testing on 170 reports (120 structured, 50 unstructured) for evaluation. The pipeline's performance was assessed using both strict and lenient criteria for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results In extraction tasks, ThyroPath achieved overall strict F-1 scores of 93% for structured reports and 90 for unstructured reports, covering 18 thyroid cancer pathology features. In classification tasks, ThyroPath-extracted information demonstrated an overall accuracy of 93% in categorizing reports based on their corresponding guideline-based risk of recurrence: 76.9% for high-risk, 86.8% for intermediate risk, and 100% for both low and very low-risk cases. However, ThyroPath achieved 100% accuracy across all thyroid cancer risk categories with human-extracted pathology information. Conclusions ThyroPath shows promise in automating the extraction and risk recurrence classification of thyroid pathology reports at large scale. It offers a solution to laborious manual reviews and advancing virtual registries. However, it requires further validation before implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Why I'm not Answering: Understanding Determinants of Classification of an Abstaining Classifier for Cancer Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05094v5)** | 2022-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe deployment of deep learning systems in critical real world applications requires models to make very few mistakes, and only under predictable circumstances. In this work, we address this problem using an abstaining classifier that is tuned to have $>$95% accuracy, and then identify the determinants of abstention using LIME. Essentially, we are training our model to learn the attributes of pathology reports that are likely to lead to incorrect classifications, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. We demonstrate an abstaining classifier in a multitask setting for classifying cancer pathology reports from the NCI SEER cancer registries on six tasks of interest. For these tasks, we reduce the classification error rate by factors of 2--5 by abstaining on 25--45% of the reports. For the specific task of classifying cancer site, we are able to identify metastasis, reports involving lymph nodes, and discussion of multiple cancer sites as responsible for many of the classification mistakes, and observe that the extent and types of mistakes vary systematically with cancer site (e.g., breast, lung, and prostate). When combining across three of the tasks, our model classifies 50% of the reports with an accuracy greater than 95% for three of the six tasks\edit, and greater than 85% for all six tasks on the retained samples. Furthermore, we show that LIME provides a better determinant of classification than measures of word occurrence alone. By combining a deep abstaining classifier with feature identification using LIME, we are able to identify concepts responsible for both correctness and abstention when classifying cancer sites from pathology reports. The improvement of LIME over keyword searches is statistically significant, presumably because words are assessed in context and have been identified as a local determinant of classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELM: Ensemble of Language Models for Predicting Tumor Group from Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21800v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) face a significant bottleneck in manually extracting data from unstructured pathology reports, a process crucial for tasks like tumor group assignment, which can consume 900 person-hours for approximately 100,000 reports. To address this, we introduce ELM (Ensemble of Language Models), a novel ensemble-based approach leveraging both small language models (SLMs) and large language models (LLMs). ELM utilizes six fine-tuned SLMs, where three SLMs use the top part of the pathology report and three SLMs use the bottom part. This is done to maximize report coverage. ELM requires five-out-of-six agreement for a tumor group classification. Disagreements are arbitrated by an LLM with a carefully curated prompt. Our evaluation across nineteen tumor groups demonstrates ELM achieves an average precision and recall of 0.94, outperforming single-model and ensemble-without-LLM approaches.

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Elicitation with Large Language Models for Interpretable Cancer Stage Identification from Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01052v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer staging is critical for patient prognosis and treatment planning, yet extracting pathologic TNM staging from unstructured pathology reports poses a persistent challenge. Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG), employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited annotated data.</p></details> |  |

Extracting details of the colonoscopy findings from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to determine patient risk for CRC and colorectal screening strategies. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a deep learning model framework to extract information for the clinical decision support system to interpret relevant free-text reports, including indications, pathology, and findings notes. The Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF framework was developed using Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to extract several clinical features from these free-text reports including indications for the colonoscopy, findings during the colonoscopy, and pathology of resected material. We trained the Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and existing Bi-LSTM-CRF models on 80% of 4,000 manually annotated notes from 3,867 patients. These clinical notes were from a group of patients over 40 years of age enrolled in four Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. A total of 10% of the remaining annotated notes were used to train hyperparameter and the remaining 10% were used to evaluate the accuracy of our model Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and compare to Bi-LSTM-CRF.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10536v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging large language models for structured information extraction from pathology reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12183v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Structured information extraction from unstructured histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research. Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to manual extraction by a trained human annotator. Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family, which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111 histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study, extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary. Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama 3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106, respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p <0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for self-hosting. Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language. Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate analytics through improved accessibility and interoperability.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

In this study we developed a robust system for automated extraction of the specific cancer types for the purpose of supporting precision oncology research. from pathology reports using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model. This model significantly outperformed the baseline model and a Large Language Model, Mistral 7B, achieving F1_Bertscore 0.98 and overall exact match of 80.61%. This fine-tuning approach demonstrates the potential for scalability that can integrate seamlessly into the molecular tumour board process. Fine-tuning domain-specific models for precision tasks in oncology, may pave the way for more efficient and accurate clinical information extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enriched Annotations for Tumor Attribute Classification from Pathology Reports with Limited Labeled Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08113v1)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision medicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but much of the data for patients is locked away in unstructured free-text, limiting research and delivery of effective personalized treatments. Generating large annotated datasets for information extraction from clinical notes is often challenging and expensive due to the high level of expertise needed for high quality annotations. To enable natural language processing for small dataset sizes, we develop a novel enriched hierarchical annotation scheme and algorithm, Supervised Line Attention (SLA), and apply this algorithm to predicting categorical tumor attributes from kidney and colon cancer pathology reports from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Whereas previous work only annotated document level labels, we in addition ask the annotators to enrich the traditional label by asking them to also highlight the relevant line or potentially lines for the final label, which leads to a 20% increase of annotation time required per document. With the enriched annotations, we develop a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm that first predicts the relevant lines in the document and then predicts the tumor attribute. Our results show across the small dataset sizes of 32, 64, 128, and 186 labeled documents per cancer, SLA only requires half the number of labeled documents as state-of-the-art methods to achieve similar or better micro-f1 and macro-f1 scores for the vast majority of comparisons that we made. Accounting for the increased annotation time, this leads to a 40% reduction in total annotation time over the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10573v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 tables and 6 figures</p></details> |

This lead to the current generalized standards that are being continuously updated as new findings are reported. It is noticeable that these effective standards are developed based on a multi-source heterogeneous data, including whole-slide images and pathology and clinical reports. In this study, we propose a framework that combines pathological images and medical reports to generate a personalized diagnosis result for individual patient. We use nuclei-level image feature similarity and content-based deep learning method to search for a personalized group of population with similar pathological characteristics, extract structured prognostic information from descriptive pathology reports of the similar patient population, and assign importance of different prognostic factors to generate a personalized pathological diagnosis result. We use multi-source heterogeneous data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. The result demonstrate that our framework matches the performance of pathologists in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. This framework is designed to be generic, thus could be applied for other types of cancer. The weights could provide insights to the known prognostic factors and further guide more precise clinical treatment protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2021 accepted, including 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

For case usage, these models were applied for the annotation tasks in clinician-oriented pathology reports for prostatectomy specimens. The true positive rate (TPR) for slides with prostate cancer was 99.7% by a false positive rate of 0.785%. The F1-scores of Gleason patterns reported in pathology reports ranged from 0.795 to 1.0 at the case level. TPR was 93.6% for the cribriform morphology and 72.6% for the ductal morphology. The correlation between the ground truth and the prediction for the relative tumor volume was 0.987 n. Our models cover the major components of prostate pathology and successfully accomplish the annotation tasks.</p></details> |  |

While recent vision-language models achieve strong results in general radiology report generation, they often fail to adequately describe rare but clinically important pathologies like fractures. This work addresses this gap by developing specialized models for fracture pathology detection and description. We train fracture-specific vision-language models with encoders from MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, demonstrating significant improvements over general-purpose models in generating accurate fracture descriptions. Analysis of model outputs by fracture type, location, and age reveals distinct strengths and limitations of current vision-language model architectures. We publicly release our best-performing fracture-reporting model, facilitating future research in accurate reporting of rare pathologies.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Multimodal Whole Slide Foundation Model for Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19666v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows, highlighting the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare data extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15362v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages |

We compare alternative architectures in terms of prediction accuracy and interpretability and show that our best model achieves a multiclass accuracy of 90.3% on topography site assignment and 84.8% on morphology type assignment. We found that in this context hierarchical models are not better than flat models and that an element-wise maximum aggregator is slightly better than attentive models on site classification.

Materials and Methods: Define and validate the RRCP dataset for a set of subreddits related to chronic pain. Identify the main concerns discussed in each subreddit. Model each subreddit according to their main concerns. Compare subreddit models. Results: The RRCP dataset comprises 86,537 Reddit submissions from 12 subreddits related to chronic pain (each related to one pathological background). Each RRCP subreddit has various main concerns. Some of these concerns are shared between multiple subreddits (e.g., the subreddit Sciatica semantically entails the subreddit backpain in their various concerns, but not the other way around), whilst some concerns are exclusive to specific subreddits (e.g., Interstitialcystitis and CrohnsDisease). Discussion: These results suggest that the reported experience of chronic pain, from multiple pathologies (i.e., subreddits), has concerns relevant to all, and concerns exclusive to certain pathologies. Our analysis details each of these concerns and their similarity relations. Conclusion: Although limited by intrinsic qualities of the Reddit platform, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work attempting to model the linguistic expression of various chronic pain-inducing pathologies and comparing these models to identify and quantify the similarities and differences between the corresponding emergent chronic pain experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 26 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, manually writing detailed reports brings heavy workloads for pathologists. To improve efficiency, some existing works have studied automatic generation of cytopathology reports, mainly by applying image caption generation frameworks with visual encoders originally proposed for natural images. A common weakness of these works is that they do not explicitly model the structural information among cells, which is a key feature of pathology images and provides significant information for making diagnoses. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based framework called GNNFormer, which seamlessly integrates graph neural network (GNN) and Transformer into the same framework, for cytopathology report generation. To the best of our knowledge, GNNFormer is the first report generation method that explicitly models the structural information among cells in pathology images. It also effectively fuses structural information among cells, fine-grained morphology features of cells and background features to generate high-quality reports. Experimental results on the NMI-WSI dataset show that GNNFormer can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

While clinicians consider this interplay between anatomy and pathology, recent deep learning algorithms specialize in recognizing either one of the two, rarely considering the patient's body from such a joint perspective. In this paper, we develop a generalist segmentation model that combines anatomical and pathological information, aiming to enhance the segmentation accuracy of pathological features. Our Anatomy-Pathology Exchange (APEx) training utilizes a query-based segmentation transformer which decodes a joint feature space into query-representations for human anatomy and interleaves them via a mixing strategy into the pathology-decoder for anatomy-informed pathology predictions. In doing so, we are able to report the best results across the board on FDG-PET-CT and Chest X-Ray pathology segmentation tasks with a margin of up to 3.3% as compared to strong baseline methods.

Recent efforts have utilized pre-trained contrastive image-text models like CLIP, adapting them for medical use by fine-tuning the model with chest X-ray images and corresponding reports for zero-shot pathology classification, thus eliminating the need for pathology-specific annotations. However, most studies continue to use the same contrastive learning objectives as in the general domain, overlooking the multi-labeled nature of medical image-report pairs. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning strategy that includes positive-pair loss relaxation and random sentence sampling. We aim to improve the performance of zero-shot pathology classification without relying on external knowledge. Our method can be applied to any pre-trained contrastive image-text encoder and easily transferred to out-of-domain datasets without further training, as it does not use external data. Our approach consistently improves overall zero-shot pathology classification across four chest X-ray datasets and three pre-trained models, with an average macro AUROC increase of 4.3%. Additionally, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art and marginally surpasses board-certified radiologists in zero-shot classification for the five competition pathologies in the CheXpert dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Graph Construction and Its Application in Automatic Radiology Report Generation from Radiologist's Dictation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06308v2)** | 2022-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventionally, the radiologist prepares the diagnosis notes and shares them with the transcriptionist. Then the transcriptionist prepares a preliminary formatted report referring to the notes, and finally, the radiologist reviews the report, corrects the errors, and signs off. This workflow causes significant delays and errors in the report. In current research work, we focus on applications of NLP techniques like Information Extraction (IE) and domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) to automatically generate radiology reports from radiologist's dictation. This paper focuses on KG construction for each organ by extracting information from an existing large corpus of free-text radiology reports. We develop an information extraction pipeline that combines rule-based, pattern-based, and dictionary-based techniques with lexical-semantic features to extract entities and relations. Missing information in short dictation can be accessed from the KGs to generate pathological descriptions and hence the radiology report. Generated pathological descriptions evaluated using semantic similarity metrics, which shows 97% similarity with gold standard pathological descriptions. Also, our analysis shows that our IE module is performing better than the OpenIE tool for the radiology domain. Furthermore, we include a manual qualitative analysis from radiologists, which shows that 80-85% of the generated reports are correctly written, and the remaining are partially correct.</p></details> |  |

Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |

A New Transformer Language Model for Pathology Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.06885v1)** | 2022-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology text mining is a challenging task given the reporting variability and constant new findings in cancer sub-type definitions. However, successful text mining of a large pathology database can play a critical role to advance 'big data' cancer research like similarity-based treatment selection, case identification, prognostication, surveillance, clinical trial screening, risk stratification, and many others. While there is a growing interest in developing language models for more specific clinical domains, no pathology-specific language space exist to support the rapid data-mining development in pathology space. In literature, a few approaches fine-tuned general transformer models on specialized corpora while maintaining the original tokenizer, but in fields requiring specialized terminology, these models often fail to perform adequately. We propose PathologyBERT - a pre-trained masked language model which was trained on 347,173 histopathology specimen reports and publicly released in the Huggingface repository. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that pre-training of transformer model on pathology corpora yields performance improvements on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Breast Cancer Diagnose Classification when compared to nonspecific language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to "American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA)" 2022 Annual Symposium</p></details> |

Thus, such system can reduce the burden for populating tumor registries, help registration for clinical trial as well as developing large dataset for deep learning model development using true pathologic ground truth. However, the content of breast pathology reports can be difficult for categorize due to the high linguistic variability in content and wide variety of potential diagnoses >50. Existing NLP models are primarily focused on developing classifier for primary breast cancer types (e.g. IDC, DCIS, ILC) and tumor characteristics, and ignore the rare diagnosis of cancer subtypes. We then developed a hierarchical hybrid transformer-based pipeline (59 labels) - Hierarchical Classification System for Breast Cancer Specimen Report (HCSBC), which utilizes the potential of the transformer context-preserving NLP technique and compared our model to several state of the art ML and DL models. We trained the model on the EUH data and evaluated our model's performance on two external datasets - MGH and Mayo Clinic. We publicly release the code and a live application under Huggingface spaces repository</p></details> |  |
| **[MCA-RG: Enhancing LLMs with Medical Concept Alignment for Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06992v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions. Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process. Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in radiology report generation.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Replace and Report: NLP Assisted Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17180v1)** | 2023-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical practice frequently uses medical imaging for diagnosis and treatment. A significant challenge for automatic radiology report generation is that the radiology reports are long narratives consisting of multiple sentences for both abnormal and normal findings. Therefore, applying conventional image captioning approaches to generate the whole report proves to be insufficient, as these are designed to briefly describe images with short sentences. We propose a template-based approach to generate radiology reports from radiographs. Our approach involves the following: i) using a multilabel image classifier, produce the tags for the input radiograph; ii) using a transformer-based model, generate pathological descriptions (a description of abnormal findings seen on radiographs) from the tags generated in step (i); iii) using a BERT-based multi-label text classifier, find the spans in the normal report template to replace with the generated pathological descriptions; and iv) using a rule-based system, replace the identified span with the generated pathological description. We performed experiments with the two most popular radiology report datasets, IU Chest X-ray and MIMIC-CXR and demonstrated that the BLEU-1, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and CIDEr scores are better than the State-of-the-Art models by 25%, 36%, 44% and 48% respectively, on the IU X-RAY dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate chest X-ray radiology reports by first creating small sentences for abnormal findings and then replacing them in the normal report template.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 6...</summary><p>The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics</p></details> |
| **[Ocular Diseases Diagnosis in Fundus Images using a Deep Learning: Approaches, tools and Performance evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02544v1)** | 2019-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ocular pathology detection from fundus images presents an important challenge on health care. In fact, each pathology has different severity stages that may be deduced by verifying the existence of specific lesions. Each lesion is characterized by morphological features. Moreover, several lesions of different pathologies have similar features. We note that patient may be affected simultaneously by several pathologies. Consequently, the ocular pathology detection presents a multi-class classification with a complex resolution principle. Several detection methods of ocular pathologies from fundus images have been proposed. The methods based on deep learning are distinguished by higher performance detection, due to their capability to configure the network with respect to the detection objective. This work proposes a survey of ocular pathology detection methods based on deep learning. First, we study the existing methods either for lesion segmentation or pathology classification. Afterwards, we extract the principle steps of processing and we analyze the proposed neural network structures. Subsequently, we identify the hardware and software environment required to employ the deep learning architecture. Thereafter, we investigate about the experimentation principles involved to evaluate the methods and the databases used either for training and testing phases. The detection performance ratios and execution times are also reported and discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12711v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

While pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore, ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from 20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification, biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across 27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks, including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade tasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation underline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward more efficient and high-quality medical services.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathAlign: A vision-language model for whole slide images in histopathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19578v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages and 19 pages of supplemental material; 3 main tables, 3 main figures and 11 supplemental tables, 7 supplemental figures</p></details> |

To overcome data-scarcity in computational pathology, recent studies exploit transfer learning to reuse knowledge gained from natural images in pathology image analysis, aiming to build effective pathology image diagnosis models. Since transferability of knowledge heavily depends on the similarity of the original and target tasks, significant differences in image content and statistics between pathology images and natural images raise the questions: how much knowledge is transferable? Is the transferred information equally contributed by pre-trained layers? To answer these questions, this paper proposes a framework to quantify knowledge gain by a particular layer, conducts an empirical investigation in pathology image centered transfer learning, and reports some interesting observations. Particularly, compared to the performance baseline obtained by random-weight model, though transferability of off-the-shelf representations from deep layers heavily depend on specific pathology image sets, the general representation generated by early layers does convey transferred knowledge in various image classification applications. The observation in this study encourages further investigation of specific metric and tools to quantify effectiveness and feasibility of transfer learning in future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exper...</summary><p>Experimentation data correction</p></details> |

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classifying Cancer Stage with Open-Source Clinical Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01589v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer stage classification is important for making treatment and care management plans for oncology patients. Information on staging is often included in unstructured form in clinical, pathology, radiology and other free-text reports in the electronic health record system, requiring extensive work to parse and obtain. To facilitate the extraction of this information, previous NLP approaches rely on labeled training datasets, which are labor-intensive to prepare. In this study, we demonstrate that without any labeled training data, open-source clinical large language models (LLMs) can extract pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging information from real-world pathology reports. Our experiments compare LLMs and a BERT-based model fine-tuned using the labeled data. Our findings suggest that while LLMs still exhibit subpar performance in Tumor (T) classification, with the appropriate adoption of prompting strategies, they can achieve comparable performance on Metastasis (M) classification and improved performance on Node (N) classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (IEEE ICHI 2024)</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art computer-aided diagnosis tools utilize a fixed set of predefined categories automatically extracted from these medical reports for training. This form of supervision limits the potential usage of models as they are unable to pick up on anomalies outside of their predefined set, thus, making it a necessity to retrain the classifier with additional data when faced with novel classes. In contrast, we investigate direct text supervision to break away from this closed set assumption. By doing so, we avoid noisy label extraction via text classifiers and incorporate more contextual information. We employ a contrastive global-local dual-encoder architecture to learn concepts directly from unstructured medical reports while maintaining its ability to perform free form classification. We investigate relevant properties of open set recognition for radiological data and propose a method to employ currently weakly annotated data into training. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale chest X-Ray datasets MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and ChestX-Ray14 for disease classification. We show that despite using unstructured medical report supervision, we perform on par with direct label supervision through a sophisticated inference setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Provi...</summary><p>Provisionally Accepted at MICCAI2022</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Multitask Representation Learning for Pathology Biobank Metadata Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07846v1)** | 2019-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[Causal Disentanglement for Robust Long-tail Medical Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14450v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual medical image generation effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances the interpretability of medical images. However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Enriched Medical Concept Generation for Chest X-ray Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02935v1)** | 2021-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision support tools that rely on supervised learning require large amounts of expert annotations. Using past radiological reports obtained from hospital archiving systems has many advantages as training data above manual single-class labels: they are expert annotations available in large quantities, covering a population-representative variety of pathologies, and they provide additional context to pathology diagnoses, such as anatomical location and severity. Learning to auto-generate such reports from images present many challenges such as the difficulty in representing and generating long, unstructured textual information, accounting for spelling errors and repetition/redundancy, and the inconsistency across different annotators. We therefore propose to first learn visually-informative medical concepts from raw reports, and, using the concept predictions as image annotations, learn to auto-generate structured reports directly from images. We validate our approach on the OpenI [2] chest x-ray dataset, which consists of frontal and lateral views of chest x-ray images, their corresponding raw textual reports and manual medical subject heading (MeSH ) annotations made by radiologists.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI ML-CDS Workshop 2019</p></details> |

After pre-training a vision transformer with Dataset 1, we integrated it with an LLM influenced by the LLAVA network. Then, the model was fine-tuned, primarily using Dataset 2. The model's diagnostic performance for major pathological findings was evaluated, along with the acceptability of radiologic reports by human radiologists, to gauge its potential for autonomous reporting. Results: The model demonstrated impressive performance in test sets, achieving an average F1 score of 0.81 for six major pathological findings in the MIMIC internal test set and 0.62 for seven major pathological findings in the external test set. The model's F1 scores surpassed those of GPT-4-vision and Gemini-Pro-Vision in both test sets. In human radiologist evaluations of the external test set, the model achieved a 72.7% success rate in autonomous reporting, slightly below the 84.0% rate of ground truth reports. Conclusion: This study highlights the significant potential of multimodal LLMs for CXR interpretation, while also acknowledging the performance limitations. Despite these challenges, we believe that making our model open-source will catalyze further research, expanding its effectiveness and applicability in various clinical contexts.

Here, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc is extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts with abundant image features to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies without the reliance on expert image annotations. We conduct primary experiments on a dataset of 220K pairs of image-report chest X-ray images and perform validation across eight external datasets encompassing 34 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both annotation-free localization and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of AFLoc on other modalities, including histopathology and retinal fundus images. We show that AFLoc exhibits robust generalization capabilities, even surpassing human benchmarks in localizing five different types of pathological images. These results highlight the potential of AFLoc in reducing annotation requirements and its applicability in complex clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Entity Driven Triplet Mining for Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15929v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnostic imaging relies on interpreting both images and radiology reports, but the growing data volumes place significant pressure on medical experts, yielding increased errors and workflow backlogs. Medical vision-language models (med-VLMs) have emerged as a powerful framework to efficiently process multimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit their performance hinges on how well image and text representations are aligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive learning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of fine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to suboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven Triplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through multimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as adjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment methods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured meta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant intra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based entity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from CXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public datasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a novel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors. Lastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit within- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology characteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance in downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art alignment methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This can be notably prohibitive for models in specialized domains, such as computational pathology. Conditioning on labeled data is known to help in data-efficient model training. Therefore, histopathology reports, which are rich in valuable clinical information, are an ideal choice as guidance for a histopathology generative model. In this paper, we introduce PathLDM, the first text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model tailored for generating high-quality histopathology images. Leveraging the rich contextual information provided by pathology text reports, our approach fuses image and textual data to enhance the generation process. By utilizing GPT's capabilities to distill and summarize complex text reports, we establish an effective conditioning mechanism. Through strategic conditioning and necessary architectural enhancements, we achieved a SoTA FID score of 7.64 for text-to-image generation on the TCGA-BRCA dataset, significantly outperforming the closest text-conditioned competitor with FID 30.1.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2024 publication</p></details> |

We propose a new Optic Nerve Head (ONH)-based prediction enhancement for the segmentation of atrophy and fovea. Models trained with 400 available training images achieved an AUC of 0.9867 for pathological myopia classification, and a Euclidean distance of 58.27 pixels on the fovea localization task, evaluated on a test set of 400 images.

Our work was acknowledged with an award in the context of the "PathologicAL Myopia detection from retinal images" challenge held during the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (April 2019).

The rise of multimodal large models has simplified the process of integrating image analysis with textual descriptions. Despite this advancement, the substantial costs associated with training and deploying these complex multimodal models, together with a scarcity of high-quality training datasets, create a significant divide between cutting-edge technology and its application in the clinical setting.

We have fine-tuned multimodal large models, specifically LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternLM, with this dataset to enhance instruction-based performance. We conducted a qualitative assessment of the capabilities of the base model and the fine-tuned model in performing image captioning and classification tasks on the specific dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits proficiency in addressing typical pathological questions. We hope that by making both our models and datasets publicly available, they can be valuable to the medical and research communities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

Numerous FMs have been developed in pathology, and there are reported cases of their application in various tasks, such as disease diagnosis, rare cancer diagnosis, patient survival prognosis prediction, biomarker expression prediction, and the scoring of immunohistochemical expression intensity. However, several challenges remain for the clinical application of FMs, which healthcare professionals, as users, must be aware of. Research is ongoing to address these challenges. In the future, it is expected that the development of Generalist Medical AI, which integrates pathology FMs with FMs from other medical domains, will progress, leading to the effective utilization of AI in real clinical settings to promote precision and personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, it is important to work on low-resolution images since it could be a cheaper alternative for remote healthcare access where the primary need of automated pathology identification models occurs. Medical diagnosis using low-resolution images is challenging since critical details may not be easily identifiable. In this paper, we report classification results by experimenting on different input image sizes of Chest X-rays to deep CNN models and discuss the feasibility of classification on varying image sizes. We also leverage the noisy labels in the dataset by proposing a Randomized Flipping of labels techniques. We use an ensemble of multi-label classification models on frontal and lateral studies. Our models are trained on 5 out of the 14 chest pathologies of the publicly available CheXpert dataset. We incorporate techniques such as augmentation, regularization for model improvement and use class activation maps to visualize the neural network's decision making. Comparison with classification results on data from 200 subjects, obtained on the corresponding high-resolution images, reported in the original CheXpert paper, has been presented. For pathologies Cardiomegaly, Consolidation and Edema, we obtain 3% higher accuracy with our model architecture.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Generative AI "co-pilots" now demonstrate the ability to mine subtle, sub-visual tissue cues across the cellular-to-pathology spectrum, generate comprehensive reports, and respond to complex user queries. The scale of data has surged dramatically, growing from tens to millions of multi-gigapixel tissue images, while the number of trainable parameters in these models has risen to several billion. The critical question remains: how will this new wave of generative and multi-purpose AI transform clinical diagnostics? In this article, we explore the true potential of these innovations and their integration into clinical practice. We review the rapid progress of foundation models in pathology, clarify their applications and significance. More precisely, we examine the very definition of foundational models, identifying what makes them foundational, general, or multipurpose, and assess their impact on computational pathology. Additionally, we address the unique challenges associated with their development and evaluation. These models have demonstrated exceptional predictive and generative capabilities, but establishing global benchmarks is crucial to enhancing evaluation standards and fostering their widespread clinical adoption. In computational pathology, the broader impact of frontier AI ultimately depends on widespread adoption and societal acceptance. While direct public exposure is not strictly necessary, it remains a powerful tool for dispelling misconceptions, building trust, and securing regulatory support.</p></details> | 63 pages, 7 figures |

However, there exists a pathology of deep Gaussian processes that their learning capacities reduce significantly when the number of layers increases. In this paper, we present a new analysis in DGPs by studying its corresponding nonlinear dynamic systems to explain the issue. Existing work reports the pathology for the squared exponential kernel function. We extend our investigation to four types of common stationary kernel functions. The recurrence relations between layers are analytically derived, providing a tighter bound and the rate of convergence of the dynamic systems. We demonstrate our finding with a number of experimental results.</p></details> | AAAI 2021 |

Recently, multi-modal language-guided image segmentation methods have emerged as a promising solution for chest X-rays where the clinical text reports, depicting the assessment of the images, are used as guidance. Nevertheless, existing language-guided methods require clinical reports alongside the images, and hence, they are not applicable for use in image segmentation in a decision support context, but rather limited to retrospective image analysis after clinical reporting has been completed. In this study, we propose a self-guided segmentation framework (SGSeg) that leverages language guidance for training (multi-modal) while enabling text-free inference (uni-modal), which is the first that enables text-free inference in language-guided segmentation. We exploit the critical location information of both pulmonary and pathological structures depicted in the text reports and introduce a novel localization-enhanced report generation (LERG) module to generate clinical reports for self-guidance. Our LERG integrates an object detector and a location-based attention aggregator, weakly-supervised by a location-aware pseudo-label extraction module. Extensive experiments on a well-benchmarked QaTa-COV19 dataset demonstrate that our SGSeg achieved superior performance than existing uni-modal segmentation methods and closely matched the state-of-the-art performance of multi-modal language-guided segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvments or corrections</p></details> |

A plethora of different data sources ranging from tissue microarray data to gene expression, proteomics or metabolomics data provide a detailed overview of the health status of a patient. Medical doctors need to assess these information sources and they rely on data driven automatic analysis tools. Methods for classification, grouping and segmentation of heterogeneous data sources as well as regression of noisy dependencies and estimation of survival probabilities enter the processing workflow of a pathology diagnosis system at various stages. This paper reports on state-of-the-art of the design and effectiveness of computational pathology workflows and it discusses future research directions in this emergent field of medical informatics and diagnostic machine learning.</p></details> |  |

These reports express a radiologist's interpretation of a medical imaging examination and are critical in establishing a diagnosis and formulating a treatment plan. In this paper, we propose a Bi-directional convolutional neural network (Bi-CNN) model for the interpretation and classification of mammograms based on breast density and chest radiographic radiology reports based on the basis of chest pathology. The proposed approach helps to organize databases of radiology reports, retrieve them expeditiously, and evaluate the radiology report that could be used in an auditing system to decrease incorrect diagnoses.

Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Health Intelligence, in conjunction with the Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March 2025</p></details> |
| **[DiagR1: A Vision-Language Model Trained via Reinforcement Learning for Digestive Pathology Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18433v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

Current report generation systems for chest X-rays (CXR) often lack mechanisms for validating outputs without expert oversight, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the semantic alignment and localization accuracy of AI-generated medical reports. Our framework integrates two key modules: a Phrase Grounding Model, which identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images based on textual prompts, and a Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, which generates synthetic CXR images from prompts while preserving anatomical fidelity. By comparing features between the original and generated images, we introduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy, while the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment. The integration of phrase grounding with diffusion models, coupled with the dual-scoring evaluation system, provides a robust mechanism for validating report quality, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

Computational Pathology (CPath) offers an integrated solution to utilize information embedded in pathology WSIs beyond what we obtain through visual assessment. For automated analysis of WSIs and validation of machine learning (ML) models, annotations at the slide, tissue and cellular levels are required. The annotation of important visual constructs in pathology images is an important component of CPath projects. Improper annotations can result in algorithms which are hard to interpret and can potentially produce inaccurate and inconsistent results. Despite the crucial role of annotations in CPath projects, there are no well-defined guidelines or best practices on how annotations should be carried out. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by presenting the experience and best practices acquired during the execution of a large-scale annotation exercise involving a multidisciplinary team of pathologists, ML experts and researchers as part of the Pathology image data Lake for Analytics, Knowledge and Education (PathLAKE) consortium. We present a real-world case study along with examples of different types of annotations, diagnostic algorithm, annotation data dictionary and annotation constructs. The analyses reported in this work highlight best practice recommendations that can be used as annotation guidelines over the lifecycle of a CPath project.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive and Multi-Path Holistically Nested Neural Networks for Pathological Lung Segmentation from CT Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03702v1)** | 2018-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological lung segmentation (PLS) is an important, yet challenging, medical image application due to the wide variability of pathological lung appearance and shape. Because PLS is often a pre-requisite for other imaging analytics, methodological simplicity and generality are key factors in usability. Along those lines, we present a bottom-up deep-learning based approach that is expressive enough to handle variations in appearance, while remaining unaffected by any variations in shape. We incorporate the deeply supervised learning framework, but enhance it with a simple, yet effective, progressive multi-path scheme, which more reliably merges outputs from different network stages. The result is a deep model able to produce finer detailed masks, which we call progressive holistically-nested networks (P-HNNs). Using extensive cross-validation, our method is tested on multi-institutional datasets comprising 929 CT scans (848 publicly available), of pathological lungs, reporting mean dice scores of 0.985 and demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements over state-of-the art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 4 figures, MICCAI 2007</p></details> |

DRR-RATE comprises of 50,188 frontal Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) from 21,304 unique patients. Each image is paired with a corresponding radiology text report and binary labels for 18 pathology classes. Given the controllable nature of DRR generation, it facilitates the inclusion of lateral view images and images from any desired viewing position. This opens up avenues for research into new and novel multimodal applications involving paired CT, X-ray images from various views, text, and binary labels. We demonstrate the applicability of DRR-RATE alongside existing large-scale chest X-ray resources, notably the CheXpert dataset and CheXnet model. Experiments demonstrate that CheXnet, when trained and tested on the DRR-RATE dataset, achieves sufficient to high AUC scores for the six common pathologies cited in common literature: Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Lung Lesion, Lung Opacity, and Pleural Effusion. Additionally, CheXnet trained on the CheXpert dataset can accurately identify several pathologies, even when operating out of distribution. This confirms that the generated DRR images effectively capture the essential pathology features from CT images. The dataset and labels are publicly accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/farrell236/DRR-RATE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross Modal Global Local Representation Learning from Radiology Reports and X-Ray Chest Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10951v1)** | 2023-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models can be applied successfully in real-work problems; however, training most of these models requires massive data. Recent methods use language and vision, but unfortunately, they rely on datasets that are not usually publicly available. Here we pave the way for further research in the multimodal language-vision domain for radiology. In this paper, we train a representation learning method that uses local and global representations of the language and vision through an attention mechanism and based on the publicly available Indiana University Radiology Report (IU-RR) dataset. Furthermore, we use the learned representations to diagnose five lung pathologies: atelectasis, cardiomegaly, edema, pleural effusion, and consolidation. Finally, we use both supervised and zero-shot classifications to extensively analyze the performance of the representation learning on the IU-RR dataset. Average Area Under the Curve (AUC) is used to evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers for classifying the five lung pathologies. The average AUC for classifying the five lung pathologies on the IU-RR test set ranged from 0.85 to 0.87 using the different training datasets, namely CheXpert and CheXphoto. These results compare favorably to other studies using UI-RR. Extensive experiments confirm consistent results for classifying lung pathologies using the multimodal global local representations of language and vision information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Computer-Aided Diagnosis, SPIE Medical Imaging 2023</p></details> |

Deep neural networks have the potential to identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains \textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496 patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from 2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients. It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance of 85\%.

However, its potential to learn unintended demographic biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC: 0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI deployment in pathology.

However, access to high-quality labeled histopathological images of breast cancer is a big challenge that limits the development of accurate and robust deep learning models. In this scoping review, we identified the publicly available datasets of breast H&E stained whole-slide images (WSI) that can be used to develop deep learning algorithms. We systematically searched nine scientific literature databases and nine research data repositories and found 17 publicly available datasets containing 10385 H&E WSIs of breast cancer. Moreover, we reported image metadata and characteristics for each dataset to assist researchers in selecting proper datasets for specific tasks in breast cancer computational pathology. In addition, we compiled two lists of breast H&E patches and private datasets as supplementary resources for researchers. Notably, only 28% of the included articles utilized multiple datasets, and only 14% used an external validation set, suggesting that the performance of other developed models may be susceptible to overestimation. The TCGA-BRCA was used in 52% of the selected studies. This dataset has a considerable selection bias that can impact the robustness and generalizability of the trained algorithms. There is also a lack of consistent metadata reporting of breast WSI datasets that can be an issue in developing accurate deep learning models, indicating the necessity of establishing explicit guidelines for documenting breast WSI dataset characteristics and metadata.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages (including references), 8 figures, 3 tables, 5 supporting information materials</p></details> |

Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep learning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine learning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We demonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal cancer modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>camer...</summary><p>camera ready version for ML4H 2025</p></details> |

Automated algorithms and tools have the potential to support the reading workflow, improve efficiency, and reduce reading errors. With the availability of large scale data sets, several methods have been proposed to classify pathologies on chest X-ray images. However, most methods report performance based on random image based splitting, ignoring the high probability of the same patient appearing in both training and test set. In addition, most methods fail to explicitly incorporate the spatial information of abnormalities or utilize the high resolution images. We propose a novel approach based on location aware Dense Networks (DNetLoc), whereby we incorporate both high-resolution image data and spatial information for abnormality classification. We evaluate our method on the largest data set reported in the community, containing a total of 86,876 patients and 297,541 chest X-ray images. We achieve (i) the best average AUC score for published training and test splits on the single benchmarking data set (ChestX-Ray14), and (ii) improved AUC scores when the pathology location information is explicitly used. To foster future research we demonstrate the limitations of the current benchmarking setup and provide new reference patient-wise splits for the used data sets. This could support consistent and meaningful benchmarking of future methods on the largest publicly available data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CancerBERT: a BERT model for Extracting Breast Cancer Phenotypes from Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.11303v2)** | 2022-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of breast cancer patients' phenotypes is important for clinical decision support and clinical research. Current models do not take full advantage of cancer domain-specific corpus, whether pre-training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model on cancer-specific corpus could improve the performances of extracting breast cancer phenotypes from texts data remains to be explored. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the CancerBERT model for extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts in electronic health records. This data used in the study included 21,291 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2020, patients' clinical notes and pathology reports were collected from the University of Minnesota Clinical Data Repository (UMN). Results: About 3 million clinical notes and pathology reports in electronic health records for 21,291 breast cancer patients were collected to train the CancerBERT model. 200 pathology reports and 50 clinical notes of breast cancer patients that contain 9,685 sentences and 221,356 tokens were manually annotated by two annotators. 20% of the annotated data was used as a test set. Our CancerBERT model achieved the best performance with macro F1 scores equal to 0.876 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for exact match and 0.904 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for the lenient match. The NER models we developed would facilitate the automated information extraction from clinical texts to further help clinical decision support. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, we focused on the breast cancer-related concepts extraction from EHR data and obtained a comprehensive annotated dataset that contains 7 types of breast cancer-related concepts. The CancerBERT model with customized vocabulary could significantly improve the performance for extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts.</p></details> |  |

However, many pre-training tasks require extra annotations from clinicians, and most of them fail to explicitly guide the model to learn the desired features of different pathologies. In this paper, we utilize Visual Question Answering (VQA) for multimodal pre-training to guide the framework focusing on targeted pathological features. We leverage descriptions in medical reports to design multi-granular question-answer pairs associated with different diseases, which assist the framework in pre-training without requiring extra annotations from experts. We also propose a novel pre-training framework with a quasi-textual feature transformer, a module designed to transform visual features into a quasi-textual space closer to the textual domain via a contrastive learning strategy. This narrows the vision-language gap and facilitates modality alignment. Our framework is applied to four downstream tasks: report generation, classification, segmentation, and detection across five datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

An automated digital pathology system could serve as a second reader, perform initial triage in large screening studies, or assist in reporting. However, it is expensive to exhaustively annotate large histology image databases, since medical specialists are a scarce resource. In this paper, we apply the semi-supervised teacher-student knowledge distillation technique proposed by Yalniz et al. (2019) to the task of quantifying prognostic features in colorectal cancer. We obtain accuracy improvements through extending this approach to a chain of students, where each student's predictions are used to train the next student i.e. the student becomes the teacher. Using the chain approach, and only 0.5% labelled data (the remaining 99.5% in the unlabelled pool), we match the accuracy of training on 100% labelled data. At lower percentages of labelled data, similar gains in accuracy are seen, allowing some recovery of accuracy even from a poor initial choice of labelled training set. In conclusion, this approach shows promise for reducing the annotation burden, thus increasing the affordability of automated digital pathology systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>AI fo...</summary><p>AI for Affordable Healthcare (AI4AH) workshop at ICLR 2020</p></details> |
| **[Multi stain graph fusion for multimodal integration in pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12541v1)** | 2022-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pathology, tissue samples are assessed using multiple staining techniques to enhance contrast in unique histologic features. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal CNN-GNN based graph fusion approach that leverages complementary information from multiple non-registered histopathology images to predict pathologic scores. We demonstrate this approach in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by predicting CRN fibrosis stage and NAFLD Activity Score (NAS). Primary assessment of NASH typically requires liver biopsy evaluation on two histological stains: Trichrome (TC) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Our multimodal approach learns to extract complementary information from TC and H&E graphs corresponding to each stain while simultaneously learning an optimal policy to combine this information. We report up to 20% improvement in predicting fibrosis stage and NAS component grades over single-stain modeling approaches, measured by computing linearly weighted Cohen's kappa between machine-derived vs. pathologist consensus scores. Broadly, this paper demonstrates the value of leveraging diverse pathology images for improved ML-powered histologic assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Multiparametric MRI with Optimized Synthetic Correlated Diffusion Imaging to Enhance Breast Cancer Pathologic Complete Response Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07854v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 2020, 685,000 deaths across the world were attributed to breast cancer, underscoring the critical need for innovative and effective breast cancer treatment. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has recently gained popularity as a promising treatment strategy for breast cancer, attributed to its efficacy in shrinking large tumors and leading to pathologic complete response. However, the current process to recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy relies on the subjective evaluation of medical experts which contain inherent biases and significant uncertainty. A recent study, utilizing volumetric deep radiomic features extracted from synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$), demonstrated significant potential in noninvasive breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Inspired by the positive outcomes of optimizing CDI$^s$ for prostate cancer delineation, this research investigates the application of optimized CDI$^s$ to enhance breast cancer pathologic complete response prediction. Using multiparametric MRI that fuses optimized CDI$^s$ with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), we obtain a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 93.28%, over 5.5% higher than that previously reported.</p></details> |  |

The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis. Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening. Future work will focus on improving the detection of subtle pathologies and addressing dataset biases to enhance its generalizability and application in diverse global healthcare settings.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms. Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in determining cancer stage, thereby demonstrating the potential to use these models in clinical or other domains where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME'24)</p></details> |

Specifically, the authors demonstrate their approach by extracting structured condition codes from pathology reports. The proposed approach utilizes local LLMs, which can be fine-tuned to respond to specific generative instructions and provide structured outputs. The authors collected a dataset of over 150k uncurated surgical pathology reports, containing gross descriptions, final diagnoses, and condition codes. They trained different model architectures, including LLaMA, BERT and LongFormer and evaluated their performance. The results show that the LLaMA-based models significantly outperform BERT-style models across all evaluated metrics, even with extremely reduced precision. The LLaMA models performed especially well with large datasets, demonstrating their ability to handle complex, multi-label tasks. Overall, this work presents an effective approach for utilizing LLMs to perform domain-specific tasks using accessible hardware, with potential applications in the medical domain, where complex data extraction and classification are required.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Preprint of an article submitted for consideration in Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing \c{opyright} 2024 copyright World Scientific Publishing Company https://www.worldscientific.com/</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods.

| **[SimCroP: Radiograph Representation Learning with Similarity-driven Cross-granularity Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08311v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However, in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then, similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports. The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods.

| **[Automated Glaucoma Report Generation via Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM and Multimodal Clinical Data Integration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10037v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI for automated glaucoma diagnostic report generation faces two predominant challenges: content redundancy in narrative outputs and inadequate highlighting of pathologically significant features including optic disc cupping, retinal nerve fiber layer defects, and visual field abnormalities. These limitations primarily stem from current multimodal architectures' insufficient capacity to extract discriminative structural-textural patterns from fundus imaging data while maintaining precise semantic alignment with domain-specific terminology in comprehensive clinical reports. To overcome these constraints, we present the Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM Network (DA-SPL), an advanced multimodal generation framework that synergistically processes both fundus imaging and supplementary visual inputs. DA-SPL employs an Encoder-Decoder structure augmented with the novel joint dual-attention mechanism in the encoder for cross-modal feature refinement, the parallelized LSTM decoder architecture for enhanced temporal-semantic consistency, and the specialized label enhancement module for accurate disease-relevant term generation. Rigorous evaluation on standard glaucoma datasets demonstrates DA-SPL's consistent superiority over state-of-the-art models across quantitative metrics. DA-SPL exhibits exceptional capability in extracting subtle pathological indicators from multimodal inputs while generating diagnostically precise reports that exhibit strong concordance with clinical expert annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE 25th BIBE</p></details> |
| **[Decomposing Disease Descriptions for Enhanced Pathology Detection: A Multi-Aspect Vision-Language Pre-training Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07636v4)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision language pre-training (VLP) has emerged as a frontier of research, enabling zero-shot pathological recognition by comparing the query image with the textual descriptions for each disease. Due to the complex semantics of biomedical texts, current methods struggle to align medical images with key pathological findings in unstructured reports. This leads to the misalignment with the target disease's textual representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel VLP framework designed to dissect disease descriptions into their fundamental aspects, leveraging prior knowledge about the visual manifestations of pathologies. This is achieved by consulting a large language model and medical experts. Integrating a Transformer module, our approach aligns an input image with the diverse elements of a disease, generating aspect-centric image representations. By consolidating the matches from each aspect, we improve the compatibility between an image and its associated disease. Additionally, capitalizing on the aspect-oriented representations, we present a dual-head Transformer tailored to process known and unknown diseases, optimizing the comprehensive detection efficacy. Conducting experiments on seven downstream datasets, ours improves the accuracy of recent methods by up to 8.56% and 17.26% for seen and unseen categories, respectively.

| **[Pathologist-Level Grading of Prostate Biopsies with Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01368v1)** | 2019-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: An increasing volume of prostate biopsies and a world-wide shortage of uro-pathologists puts a strain on pathology departments. Additionally, the high intra- and inter-observer variability in grading can result in over- and undertreatment of prostate cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods may alleviate these problems by assisting pathologists to reduce workload and harmonize grading. Methods: We digitized 6,682 needle biopsies from 976 participants in the population based STHLM3 diagnostic study to train deep neural networks for assessing prostate biopsies. The networks were evaluated by predicting the presence, extent, and Gleason grade of malignant tissue for an independent test set comprising 1,631 biopsies from 245 men. We additionally evaluated grading performance on 87 biopsies individually graded by 23 experienced urological pathologists from the International Society of Urological Pathology. We assessed discriminatory performance by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and tumor extent predictions by correlating predicted millimeter cancer length against measurements by the reporting pathologist. We quantified the concordance between grades assigned by the AI and the expert urological pathologists using Cohen's kappa. Results: The performance of the AI to detect and grade cancer in prostate needle biopsy samples was comparable to that of international experts in prostate pathology. The AI achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.997 for distinguishing between benign and malignant biopsy cores, and 0.999 for distinguishing between men with or without prostate cancer. The correlation between millimeter cancer predicted by the AI and assigned by the reporting pathologist was 0.96. For assigning Gleason grades, the AI achieved an average pairwise kappa of 0.62. This was within the range of the corresponding values for the expert pathologists (0.60 to 0.73).</p></details> | 45 pages, 11 figures |

Prior to routine use, it is important to evaluate their predictive performance and obtain regulatory approval. This assessment requires appropriate test datasets. However, compiling such datasets is challenging and specific recommendations are missing. A committee of various stakeholders, including commercial AI developers, pathologists, and researchers, discussed key aspects and conducted extensive literature reviews on test datasets in pathology. Here, we summarize the results and derive general recommendations for the collection of test datasets. We address several questions: Which and how many images are needed? How to deal with low-prevalence subsets? How can potential bias be detected? How should datasets be reported? What are the regulatory requirements in different countries? The recommendations are intended to help AI developers demonstrate the utility of their products and to help regulatory agencies and end users verify reported performance measures. Further research is needed to formulate criteria for sufficiently representative test datasets so that AI solutions can operate with less user intervention and better support diagnostic workflows in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Reduction of Shallow CNN Model for Reliable Deployment of Information Extraction from Medical Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01572v1)** | 2020-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is a time-tested tool for the information extraction from cancer pathology reports. Shallow CNN performs competitively on this task to other deep learning models including BERT, which holds the state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks. The main insight behind this eccentric phenomenon is that the information extraction from cancer pathology reports require only a small number of domain-specific text segments to perform the task, thus making the most of the texts and contexts excessive for the task. Shallow CNN model is well-suited to identify these key short text segments from the labeled training set; however, the identified text segments remain obscure to humans. In this study, we fill this gap by developing a model reduction tool to make a reliable connection between CNN filters and relevant text segments by discarding the spurious connections. We reduce the complexity of shallow CNN representation by approximating it with a linear transformation of n-gram presence representation with a non-negativity and sparsity prior on the transformation weights to obtain an interpretable model. Our approach bridge the gap between the conventionally perceived trade-off boundary between accuracy on the one side and explainability on the other by model reduction.</p></details> |  |

The spatial augmentation is ordinary used for semantic segmentation. Tumor images under malignant are rare and to annotate the labels of nuclei region takes much time-consuming. We require an effective use of dataset to maximize the segmentation accuracy. It is expected that some augmentation to transform generalized images influence the segmentation performance. We propose a synthetic augmentation using label-to-image translation, mapping from a semantic label with the edge structure to a real image. Exactly this paper deal with stain slides of nuclei in tumor. Actually, we demonstrate several segmentation algorithms applied to the initial dataset that contains real images and labels using synthetic augmentation in order to add their generalized images. We computes and reports that a proposed synthetic augmentation procedure improve their accuracy.</p></details> | 15pages, 12 figures |

Amongst approaches to improve model interpretability, concept-based explanations aim to provide concise and human-understandable explanations of any arbitrary classifier. However, such methods usually require a large amount of manually collected data with concept annotation, which is often scarce in the medical domain. In this paper, we propose Conceptual Counterfactual Explanations for Chest X-ray (CoCoX), which leverages the joint embedding space of an existing vision-language model (VLM) to explain black-box classifier outcomes without the need for annotated datasets. Specifically, we utilize textual concepts derived from chest radiography reports and a pre-trained chest radiography-based VLM to explain three common cardiothoracic pathologies. We demonstrate that the explanations generated by our method are semantically meaningful and faithful to underlying pathologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS'24 workshop on Advancements In Medical Foundation Models: Explainability, Robustness, Security, and Beyond (AIM-FM)</p></details> |

This work defines a new task of medical image analysis, i.e., to perform myocardial pathology segmentation (MyoPS) combining three-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images, which was first proposed in the MyoPS challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2020. The challenge provided 45 paired and pre-aligned CMR images, allowing algorithms to combine the complementary information from the three CMR sequences for pathology segmentation. In this article, we provide details of the challenge, survey the works from fifteen participants and interpret their methods according to five aspects, i.e., preprocessing, data augmentation, learning strategy, model architecture and post-processing. In addition, we analyze the results with respect to different factors, in order to examine the key obstacles and explore potential of solutions, as well as to provide a benchmark for future research. We conclude that while promising results have been reported, the research is still in the early stage, and more in-depth exploration is needed before a successful application to the clinics. Note that MyoPS data and evaluation tool continue to be publicly available upon registration via its homepage (www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/myops20/).</p></details> |  |

The limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath can be overcome by FMs through learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision.

In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented.

However, the clinical accuracy of free-text reports has proven challenging to quantify using natural language processing metrics, given the complexity of medical information, the variety of writing styles, and the potential for typos and inconsistencies. Structured reporting and standardized reports, on the other hand, can provide consistency and formalize the evaluation of clinical correctness. However, high-quality annotations for structured reporting are scarce. Therefore, we propose a method to predict clinical findings defined by sentences in structured reporting templates, which can be used to fill such templates. The approach involves training a contrastive language-image model using chest X-rays and related free-text radiological reports, then creating textual prompts for each structured finding and optimizing a classifier to predict clinical findings in the medical image. Results show that even with limited image-level annotations for training, the method can accomplish the structured reporting tasks of severity assessment of cardiomegaly and localizing pathologies in chest X-rays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MIDL 2023</p></details> |

| **[Multi-Modal Foundation Models for Computational Pathology: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09091v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images. While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Driven Tumor Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18589v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tumor synthesis can generate examples that AI often misses or over-detects, improving AI performance by training on these challenging cases. However, existing synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating images from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack controllability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated tumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing to effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor synthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor characteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the AI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%), tumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and classification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by +8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis process, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic tumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses contrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly reducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this study) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports. Finally, we have developed rigorous tests to evaluate synthetic tumors, including Text-Driven Visual Turing Test and Radiomics Pattern Analysis, showing that our synthetic tumors is realistic and diverse in texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology.</p></details> |  |

Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing.

| **[ViKL: A Mammography Interpretation Framework via Multimodal Aggregation of Visual-knowledge-linguistic Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15744v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mammography is the primary imaging tool for breast cancer diagnosis. Despite significant strides in applying deep learning to interpret mammography images, efforts that focus predominantly on visual features often struggle with generalization across datasets. We hypothesize that integrating additional modalities in the radiology practice, notably the linguistic features of reports and manifestation features embodying radiological insights, offers a more powerful, interpretable and generalizable representation. In this paper, we announce MVKL, the first multimodal mammography dataset encompassing multi-view images, detailed manifestations and reports. Based on this dataset, we focus on the challanging task of unsupervised pretraining and propose ViKL, a innovative framework that synergizes Visual, Knowledge, and Linguistic features. This framework relies solely on pairing information without the necessity for pathology labels, which are often challanging to acquire. ViKL employs a triple contrastive learning approach to merge linguistic and knowledge-based insights with visual data, enabling both inter-modality and intra-modality feature enhancement. Our research yields significant findings: 1) Integrating reports and manifestations with unsupervised visual pretraining, ViKL substantially enhances the pathological classification and fosters multimodal interactions. 2) Manifestations can introduce a novel hard negative sample selection mechanism. 3) The multimodal features demonstrate transferability across different datasets. 4) The multimodal pretraining approach curbs miscalibrations and crafts a high-quality representation space. The MVKL dataset and ViKL code are publicly available at https://github.com/wxwxwwxxx/ViKL to support a broad spectrum of future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anatomy-Aware Siamese Network: Exploiting Semantic Asymmetry for Accurate Pelvic Fracture Detection in X-ray Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01464v3)** | 2020-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual cues of enforcing bilaterally symmetric anatomies as normal findings are widely used in clinical practice to disambiguate subtle abnormalities from medical images. So far, inadequate research attention has been received on effectively emulating this practice in CAD methods. In this work, we exploit semantic anatomical symmetry or asymmetry analysis in a complex CAD scenario, i.e., anterior pelvic fracture detection in trauma PXRs, where semantically pathological (refer to as fracture) and non-pathological (e.g., pose) asymmetries both occur. Visually subtle yet pathologically critical fracture sites can be missed even by experienced clinicians, when limited diagnosis time is permitted in emergency care. We propose a novel fracture detection framework that builds upon a Siamese network enhanced with a spatial transformer layer to holistically analyze symmetric image features. Image features are spatially formatted to encode bilaterally symmetric anatomies. A new contrastive feature learning component in our Siamese network is designed to optimize the deep image features being more salient corresponding to the underlying semantic asymmetries (caused by pelvic fracture occurrences). Our proposed method have been extensively evaluated on 2,359 PXRs from unique patients (the largest study to-date), and report an area under ROC curve score of 0.9771. This is the highest among state-of-the-art fracture detection methods, with improved clinical indications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2020 (camera-ready)</p></details> |

Methods: Glo-UMF decouples quantification tasks by constructing three dedicated deep models: an ultrastructure segmentation model, a glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) region classification model, and an electron-dense deposits (EDD) detection model. Their outputs are integrated through a post-processing workflow with adaptive GFB cropping and measurement location screening, enhancing measurement reliability and providing comprehensive quantitative results that overcome the limitations of traditional grading. Results: Trained on 372 electron microscopy images, Glo-UMF enables simultaneous quantification of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and EDD location. In 115 test cases spanning 9 renal pathological types, the automated quantification results showed strong agreement with pathological reports, with an average processing time of 4.23$\pm$0.48 seconds per case on a CPU environment. Conclusions: The modular design of Glo-UMF allows for flexible extensibility, supporting the joint quantification of multiple features. This framework ensures robust generalization and clinical applicability, demonstrating significant potential as an efficient auxiliary tool in glomerular pathological analysis.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Deep Learning Segmentation and Classification of Red Blood Cells Using a Large Multi-Scanner Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18468v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has recently been revolutionized by advancements in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and high-performance computing. With its advanced tools, digital pathology can help improve and speed up the diagnostic process, reduce human errors, and streamline the reporting step. In this paper, we report a new large red blood cell (RBC) image dataset and propose a two-stage deep learning framework for RBC image segmentation and classification. The dataset is a highly diverse dataset of more than 100K RBCs containing eight different classes. The dataset, which is considerably larger than any publicly available hematopathology dataset, was labeled independently by two hematopathologists who also manually created masks for RBC cell segmentation. Subsequently, in the proposed framework, first, a U-Net model was trained to achieve automatic RBC image segmentation. Second, an EfficientNetB0 model was trained to classify RBC images into one of the eight classes using a transfer learning approach with a 5X2 cross-validation scheme. An IoU of 98.03% and an average classification accuracy of 96.5% were attained on the test set. Moreover, we have performed experimental comparisons against several prominent CNN models. These comparisons show the superiority of the proposed model with a good balance between performance and computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

In order to reduce the number of positive margins would offer surgeon real-time intra-operative information on the presence of positive resection margins. This study aims to design an intra-operative tumour margin evaluation scheme by using specimen mammography in breast-conserving surgery. Total of 30 cases were evaluated and compared with the manually determined contours by experienced physicians and pathology report. The proposed method utilizes image thresholding to extract regions of interest and then performs a deep learning model, i.e. SegNet, to segment tumour tissue. The margin width of normal tissues surrounding it is evaluated as the result. The desired size of margin around the tumor was set for 10 mm. The smallest average difference to manual sketched margin (6.53 mm +- 5.84). In the all case, the SegNet architecture was utilized to obtain tissue specimen boundary and tumor contour, respectively. The simulation results indicated that this technology is helpful in discriminating positive from negative margins in the intra-operative setting. The aim of proposed scheme was a potential procedure in the intra-operative measurement system. The experimental results reveal that deep learning techniques can draw results that are consistent with pathology reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>1 pag...</summary><p>1 pages, 6 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Monitoring Potential Drug Interactions and Reactions via Network Analysis of Instagram User Timelines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01006v2)** | 2016-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much recent research aims to identify evidence for Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) and Adverse Drug reactions (ADR) from the biomedical scientific literature. In addition to this "Bibliome", the universe of social media provides a very promising source of large-scale data that can help identify DDI and ADR in ways that have not been hitherto possible. Given the large number of users, analysis of social media data may be useful to identify under-reported, population-level pathology associated with DDI, thus further contributing to improvements in population health. Moreover, tapping into this data allows us to infer drug interactions with natural products--including cannabis--which constitute an array of DDI very poorly explored by biomedical research thus far. Our goal is to determine the potential of Instagram for public health monitoring and surveillance for DDI, ADR, and behavioral pathology at large. Using drug, symptom, and natural product dictionaries for identification of the various types of DDI and ADR evidence, we have collected ~7000 timelines. We report on 1) the development of a monitoring tool to easily observe user-level timelines associated with drug and symptom terms of interest, and 2) population-level behavior via the analysis of co-occurrence networks computed from user timelines at three different scales: monthly, weekly, and daily occurrences. Analysis of these networks further reveals 3) drug and symptom direct and indirect associations with greater support in user timelines, as well as 4) clusters of symptoms and drugs revealed by the collective behavior of the observed population. This demonstrates that Instagram contains much drug- and pathology specific data for public health monitoring of DDI and ADR, and that complex network analysis provides an important toolbox to extract health-related associations and their support from large-scale social media data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pacif...</summary><p>Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. 21:492-503</p></details> |
| **[Automated Identification of Thoracic Pathology from Chest Radiographs with Enhanced Training Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06805v1)** | 2020-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest x-rays are the most common radiology studies for diagnosing lung and heart disease. Hence, a system for automated pre-reporting of pathologic findings on chest x-rays would greatly enhance radiologists' productivity. To this end, we investigate a deep-learning framework with novel training schemes for classification of different thoracic pathology labels from chest x-rays. We use the currently largest publicly available annotated dataset ChestX-ray14 of 112,120 chest radiographs of 30,805 patients. Each image was annotated with either a 'NoFinding' class, or one or more of 14 thoracic pathology labels. Subjects can have multiple pathologies, resulting in a multi-class, multi-label problem. We encoded labels as binary vectors using k-hot encoding. We study the ResNet34 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, where two key modifications were incorporated into the training framework: (1) Stochastic gradient descent with momentum and with restarts using cosine annealing, (2) Variable image sizes for fine-tuning to prevent overfitting. Additionally, we use a heuristic algorithm to select a good learning rate. Learning with restarts was used to avoid local minima. Area Under receiver operating characteristics Curve (AUC) was used to quantitatively evaluate diagnostic quality. Our results are comparable to, or outperform the best results of current state-of-the-art methods with AUCs as follows: Atelectasis:0.81, Cardiomegaly:0.91, Consolidation:0.81, Edema:0.92, Effusion:0.89, Emphysema: 0.92, Fibrosis:0.81, Hernia:0.84, Infiltration:0.73, Mass:0.85, Nodule:0.76, Pleural Thickening:0.81, Pneumonia:0.77, Pneumothorax:0.89 and NoFinding:0.79. Our results suggest that, in addition to using sophisticated network architectures, a good learning rate, scheduler and a robust optimizer can boost performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[TandemNet: Distilling Knowledge from Medical Images Using Diagnostic Reports as Optional Semantic References](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.03070v1)** | 2017-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the semantic knowledge of medical images from their diagnostic reports to provide an inspirational network training and an interpretable prediction mechanism with our proposed novel multimodal neural network, namely TandemNet. Inside TandemNet, a language model is used to represent report text, which cooperates with the image model in a tandem scheme. We propose a novel dual-attention model that facilitates high-level interactions between visual and semantic information and effectively distills useful features for prediction. In the testing stage, TandemNet can make accurate image prediction with an optional report text input. It also interprets its prediction by producing attention on the image and text informative feature pieces, and further generating diagnostic report paragraphs. Based on a pathological bladder cancer images and their diagnostic reports (BCIDR) dataset, sufficient experiments demonstrate that our method effectively learns and integrates knowledge from multimodalities and obtains significantly improved performance than comparing baselines.</p></details> | MICCAI2017 Oral |
| **[A Gabor Filter Texture Analysis Approach for Histopathological Brain Tumor Subtype Discrimination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05122v1)** | 2017-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meningioma brain tumour discrimination is challenging as many histological patterns are mixed between the different subtypes. In clinical practice, dominant patterns are investigated for signs of specific meningioma pathology; however the simple observation could result in inter- and intra-observer variation due to the complexity of the histopathological patterns. Also employing a computerised feature extraction approach applied at a single resolution scale might not suffice in accurately delineating the mixture of histopathological patterns. In this work we propose a novel multiresolution feature extraction approach for characterising the textural properties of the different pathological patterns (i.e. mainly cell nuclei shape, orientation and spatial arrangement within the cytoplasm). The pattern textural properties are characterised at various scales and orientations for an improved separability between the different extracted features. The Gabor filter energy output of each magnitude response was combined with four other fixed-resolution texture signatures (2 model-based and 2 statistical-based) with and without cell nuclei segmentation. The highest classification accuracy of 95% was reported when combining the Gabor filters energy and the meningioma subimage fractal signature as a feature vector without performing any prior cell nuceli segmentation. This indicates that characterising the cell-nuclei self-similarity properties via Gabor filters can assists in achieving an improved meningioma subtype classification, which can assist in overcoming variations in reported diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Gram Barcodes for Histopathology Tissue Texture Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15519v1)** | 2021-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in digital pathology have led to the need for Histopathology Image Retrieval (HIR) systems that search through databases of biopsy images to find similar cases to a given query image. These HIR systems allow pathologists to effortlessly and efficiently access thousands of previously diagnosed cases in order to exploit the knowledge in the corresponding pathology reports. Since HIR systems may have to deal with millions of gigapixel images, the extraction of compact and expressive image features must be available to allow for efficient and accurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the application of Gram barcodes as image features for HIR systems. Unlike most feature generation schemes, Gram barcodes are based on high-order statistics that describe tissue texture by summarizing the correlations between different feature maps in layers of convolutional neural networks. We run HIR experiments on three public datasets using a pre-trained VGG19 network for Gram barcode generation and showcase highly competitive results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anatomy-Guided Weakly-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12704v1)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating a large-scale dataset of abnormality annotation on medical images is a labor-intensive and costly task. Leveraging weak supervision from readily available data such as radiology reports can compensate lack of large-scale data for anomaly detection methods. However, most of the current methods only use image-level pathological observations, failing to utilize the relevant anatomy mentions in reports. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing (NLP)-mined weak labels are noisy due to label sparsity and linguistic ambiguity. We propose an Anatomy-Guided chest X-ray Network (AGXNet) to address these issues of weak annotation. Our framework consists of a cascade of two networks, one responsible for identifying anatomical abnormalities and the second responsible for pathological observations. The critical component in our framework is an anatomy-guided attention module that aids the downstream observation network in focusing on the relevant anatomical regions generated by the anatomy network. We use Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning to account for the fact that lack of mention does not necessarily mean a negative label. Our quantitative and qualitative results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AGXNet in disease and anatomical abnormality localization. Experiments on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset show that the learned feature representations are transferable and can achieve the state-of-the-art performances in disease classification and competitive disease localization results.

| **[XDR-LVLM: An Explainable Vision-Language Large Model for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15168v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM (eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports. These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations, showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperparameter Optimization and Reproducibility in Deep Learning Model Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15164v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets (PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8 outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5 consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon) dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

There is a proliferation in the exploration of AI assistant use cases to support radiology workflows in a reliable manner. In this work, we present RadPhi-3, a Small Language Model instruction tuned from Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct with 3.8B parameters to assist with various tasks in radiology workflows. While impression summary generation has been the primary task which has been explored in prior works w.r.t radiology reports of Chest X-rays, we also explore other useful tasks like change summary generation comparing the current radiology report and its prior report, section extraction from radiology reports, tagging the reports with various pathologies and tubes, lines or devices present in them etc. In-addition, instruction tuning RadPhi-3 involved learning from a credible knowledge source used by radiologists, Radiopaedia.org. RadPhi-3 can be used both to give reliable answers for radiology related queries as well as perform useful tasks related to radiology reports. RadPhi-3 achieves SOTA results on the RaLEs radiology report generation benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We use two basic, shallow and deep ConvNet architectures recently shown to decode task-related information from EEG at least as well as established algorithms designed for this purpose. In decoding EEG pathology, both ConvNets reached substantially better accuracies (about 6% better, ~85% vs. ~79%) than the only published result for this dataset, and were still better when using only 1 minute of each recording for training and only six seconds of each recording for testing. We used automated methods to optimize architectural hyperparameters and found intriguingly different ConvNet architectures, e.g., with max pooling as the only nonlinearity. Visualizations of the ConvNet decoding behavior showed that they used spectral power changes in the delta (0-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency range, possibly alongside other features, consistent with expectations derived from spectral analysis of the EEG data and from the textual medical reports. Analysis of the textual medical reports also highlighted the potential for accuracy increases by integrating contextual information, such as the age of subjects. In summary, the ConvNets and visualization techniques used in this study constitute a next step towards clinically useful automated EEG diagnosis and establish a new baseline for future work on this topic.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE SPMB 2017 https://www.ieeespmb.org/2017/</p></details> |
| **[Image-aware Evaluation of Generated Medical Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17357v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric for automatic medical report generation from X-ray images, VLScore. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing evaluation methods, which either focus solely on textual similarities, ignoring clinical aspects, or concentrate only on a single clinical aspect, the pathology, neglecting all other factors. The key idea of our metric is to measure the similarity between radiology reports while considering the corresponding image. We demonstrate the benefit of our metric through evaluation on a dataset where radiologists marked errors in pairs of reports, showing notable alignment with radiologists' judgments. In addition, we provide a new dataset for evaluating metrics. This dataset includes well-designed perturbations that distinguish between significant modifications (e.g., removal of a diagnosis) and insignificant ones. It highlights the weaknesses in current evaluation metrics and provides a clear framework for analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integration of Domain Knowledge using Medical Knowledge Graph Deep Learning for Cancer Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01337v1)** | 2021-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key component of deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) is word embeddings. Word embeddings that effectively capture the meaning and context of the word that they represent can significantly improve the performance of downstream DL models for various NLP tasks. Many existing word embeddings techniques capture the context of words based on word co-occurrence in documents and text; however, they often cannot capture broader domain-specific relationships between concepts that may be crucial for the NLP task at hand. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate external knowledge from medical terminology ontologies into the context captured by word embeddings. Specifically, we use a medical knowledge graph, such as the unified medical language system (UMLS), to find connections between clinical terms in cancer pathology reports. This approach aims to minimize the distance between connected clinical concepts. We evaluate the proposed approach using a Multitask Convolutional Neural Network (MT-CNN) to extract six cancer characteristics -- site, subsite, laterality, behavior, histology, and grade -- from a dataset of ~900K cancer pathology reports. The results show that the MT-CNN model which uses our domain informed embeddings outperforms the same MT-CNN using standard word2vec embeddings across all tasks, with an improvement in the overall micro- and macro-F1 scores by 4.97\%and 22.5\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pan-Cancer Diagnostic Consensus Through Searching Archival Histopathology Images Using Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08736v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of digital pathology has opened new horizons for histopathology and cytology. Artificial-intelligence algorithms are able to operate on digitized slides to assist pathologists with diagnostic tasks. Whereas machine learning involving classification and segmentation methods have obvious benefits for image analysis in pathology, image search represents a fundamental shift in computational pathology. Matching the pathology of new patients with already diagnosed and curated cases offers pathologist a novel approach to improve diagnostic accuracy through visual inspection of similar cases and computational majority vote for consensus building. In this study, we report the results from searching the largest public repository (The Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA] program by National Cancer Institute, USA) of whole slide images from almost 11,000 patients depicting different types of malignancies. For the first time, we successfully indexed and searched almost 30,000 high-resolution digitized slides constituting 16 terabytes of data comprised of 20 million 1000x1000 pixels image patches. The TCGA image database covers 25 anatomic sites and contains 32 cancer subtypes. High-performance storage and GPU power were employed for experimentation. The results were assessed with conservative "majority voting" to build consensus for subtype diagnosis through vertical search and demonstrated high accuracy values for both frozen sections slides (e.g., bladder urothelial carcinoma 93%, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma 97%, and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma 99%) and permanent histopathology slides (e.g., prostate adenocarcinoma 98%, skin cutaneous melanoma 99%, and thymoma 100%). The key finding of this validation study was that computational consensus appears to be possible for rendering diagnoses if a sufficiently large number of searchable cases are available for each cancer subtype.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multimorbidity Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval Using Proxies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.12185v1)** | 2022-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-based medical image retrieval is an important diagnostic tool that improves the explainability of computer-aided diagnosis systems and provides decision making support to healthcare professionals. Medical imaging data, such as radiology images, are often multimorbidity; a single sample may have more than one pathology present. As such, image retrieval systems for the medical domain must be designed for the multi-label scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label metric learning method that can be used for both classification and content-based image retrieval. In this way, our model is able to support diagnosis by predicting the presence of diseases and provide evidence for these predictions by returning samples with similar pathological content to the user. In practice, the retrieved images may also be accompanied by pathology reports, further assisting in the diagnostic process. Our method leverages proxy feature vectors, enabling the efficient learning of a robust feature space in which the distance between feature vectors can be used as a measure of the similarity of those samples. Unlike existing proxy-based methods, training samples are able to assign to multiple proxies that span multiple class labels. This multi-label proxy assignment results in a feature space that encodes the complex relationships between diseases present in medical imaging data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval systems and a set of baseline approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to both classification and content-based image retrieval on two multimorbidity radiology datasets.</p></details> |  |

This AI system integrates advanced architectures including Vision Transformers, Faster R-CNN, and various U Net models (such as Attention U-Net, U-Net++, and Dense U-Net) to enable comprehensive classification, detection, and segmentation of 75 distinct pathologies. To ensure robustness, the study design includes subgroup analyses across age, gender, and equipment type, validating the model's adaptability and performance across diverse patient demographics and imaging environments. Performance: The AI system achieved up to 98% precision and over 95% recall for multi pathology classification, with stable performance across demographic and equipment subgroups. For normal vs. abnormal classification, it reached 99.8% precision, 99.6% recall, and 99.9% negative predictive value (NPV). It was deployed in 17 major healthcare systems in India including diagnostic centers, large hospitals, and government hospitals. Over the deployment period, the system processed over 150,000 scans, averaging 2,000 chest X rays daily, resulting in reduced reporting times and improved diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: The high precision and recall validate the AI's capability as a reliable tool for autonomous normal abnormal classification, pathology localization, and segmentation. This scalable AI model addresses diagnostic gaps in underserved areas, optimizing radiology workflows and enhancing patient care across diverse healthcare settings in India.</p></details> | 27 pages , 8 figures |
| **[Volumetric Reconstruction of Prostatectomy Specimens from Histology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01855v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical treatment for prostate cancer often involves organ removal, i.e., prostatectomy. Pathology reports on these specimens convey treatment-relevant information. Beyond these reports, the diagnostic process generates extensive and complex information that is difficult to represent in reports, although it is of significant interest to the other medical specialties involved. 3D tissue reconstruction would allow for better spatial visualization, as well as combinations with other imaging modalities. Existing approaches in this area have proven labor-intensive and challenging to integrate into clinical workflows. 3D-SLIVER provides a simplified solution, implemented as an open-source 3DSlicer extension. We outline three specific real-world scenarios to illustrate its potential to improve transparency in diagnostic workflows and contribute to multi-modal research endeavors. Implementing the 3D reconstruction process involved four sub-modules of 3D-SLIVER: digitization of slicing protocol, virtual slicing of arbitrary 3D models based on that protocol, registration of slides with virtual slices using the Coherent Point Drift algorithm, and 3D reconstruction of registered information using convex hulls, Gaussian splatter and linear extrusion. Three use cases to employ 3D-SLIVER are presented: a low-effort approach to pathology workflow integration and two research-related use cases illustrating how to perform retrospective evaluations of PI-RADS predictions and statistically model 3D distributions of morphological patterns. 3D-SLIVER allows for improved interdisciplinary communication among specialties. It is designed for simplicity in application, allowing for flexible integration into various workflows and use cases. Here we focused on the clinical care of prostate cancer patients, but future possibilities are extensive with other neoplasms and in education and research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Whole Slide Image Classification with Fine-Grained Visual-Semantic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19326v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification is often formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in WSI classification. However, existing methods leverage coarse-grained pathogenetic descriptions for visual representation supervision, which are insufficient to capture the complex visual appearance of pathogenetic images, hindering the generalizability of models on diverse downstream tasks. Additionally, processing high-resolution WSIs can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel "Fine-grained Visual-Semantic Interaction" (FiVE) framework for WSI classification. It is designed to enhance the model's generalizability by leveraging the interaction between localized visual patterns and fine-grained pathological semantics. Specifically, with meticulously designed queries, we start by utilizing a large language model to extract fine-grained pathological descriptions from various non-standardized raw reports. The output descriptions are then reconstructed into fine-grained labels used for training. By introducing a Task-specific Fine-grained Semantics (TFS) module, we enable prompts to capture crucial visual information in WSIs, which enhances representation learning and augments generalization capabilities significantly. Furthermore, given that pathological visual patterns are redundantly distributed across tissue slices, we sample a subset of visual instances during training. Our method demonstrates robust generalizability and strong transferability, dominantly outperforming the counterparts on the TCGA Lung Cancer dataset with at least 9.19% higher accuracy in few-shot experiments. The code is available at: https://github.com/ls1rius/WSI_FiVE.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

We retrieved and filtered 4,804 relevant articles published after 2015 from the PubMed database using domain-specific keywords. After cleaning and pre-processing the abstracts, we applied two topic modeling techniques - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic - to identify latent thematic structures in the corpus. Our models uncovered 14 clinically meaningful clusters, such as infantile hyperactivity and abnormal epileptic behavior. To improve relevance and precision, we incorporated a custom stop word list tailored to speech pathology. Evaluation results showed that the LDA model achieved a coherence score of 0.42 and a perplexity of -7.5, indicating strong topic coherence and predictive performance. The BERTopic model exhibited a low proportion of outlier topics (less than 20%), demonstrating its capacity to classify heterogeneous literature effectively. These results provide a foundation for automating literature reviews in speech-language pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainability Through Human-Centric Design for XAI in Lung Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09755v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have shown promise in lung pathology detection from chest X-rays, but widespread clinical adoption remains limited due to opaque model decision-making. In prior work, we introduced ClinicXAI, a human-centric, expert-guided concept bottleneck model (CBM) designed for interpretable lung cancer diagnosis. We now extend that approach and present XpertXAI, a generalizable expert-driven model that preserves human-interpretable clinical concepts while scaling to detect multiple lung pathologies. Using a high-performing InceptionV3-based classifier and a public dataset of chest X-rays with radiology reports, we compare XpertXAI against leading post-hoc explainability methods and an unsupervised CBM, XCBs. We assess explanations through comparison with expert radiologist annotations and medical ground truth. Although XpertXAI is trained for multiple pathologies, our expert validation focuses on lung cancer. We find that existing techniques frequently fail to produce clinically meaningful explanations, omitting key diagnostic features and disagreeing with radiologist judgments. XpertXAI not only outperforms these baselines in predictive accuracy but also delivers concept-level explanations that better align with expert reasoning. While our focus remains on explainability in lung cancer detection, this work illustrates how human-centric model design can be effectively extended to broader diagnostic contexts - offering a scalable path toward clinically meaningful explainable AI in medical diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models are large, deep artificial neural networks capable of learning the context of a specific domain through training on exceptionally extensive datasets. Through validation, we have observed that the representations generated by such models exhibit inferior performance in retrieval tasks within digital pathology when compared to those generated by significantly smaller, conventional deep networks.</p></details> |  |

Generative models have gained recent attention for the increasingly realistic images they can synthesize, given a sampling of a data type. In this paper, we apply GANs to a sampling distribution of OCTs of the retina. We observe the synthesis of realistic OCT images depicting recognizable pathology such as macular holes, choroidal neovascular membranes, myopic degeneration, cystoid macular edema, and central serous retinopathy amongst others. This represents the first such report of its kind. Potential applications of this new technology include for surgical simulation, for treatment planning, for disease prognostication, and for accelerating the development of new drugs and surgical procedures to treat retinal disease.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reading Radiology Imaging Like The Radiologist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05921v3)** | 2023-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated radiology report generation aims to generate radiology reports that contain rich, fine-grained descriptions of radiology imaging. Compared with image captioning in the natural image domain, medical images are very similar to each other, with only minor differences in the occurrence of diseases. Given the importance of these minor differences in the radiology report, it is crucial to encourage the model to focus more on the subtle regions of disease occurrence. Secondly, the problem of visual and textual data biases is serious. Not only do normal cases make up the majority of the dataset, but sentences describing areas with pathological changes also constitute only a small part of the paragraph. Lastly, generating medical image reports involves the challenge of long text generation, which requires more expertise and empirical training in medical knowledge. As a result, the difficulty of generating such reports is increased. To address these challenges, we propose a disease-oriented retrieval framework that utilizes similar reports as prior knowledge references. We design a factual consistency captioning generator to generate more accurate and factually consistent disease descriptions. Our framework can find most similar reports for a given disease from the CXR database by retrieving a disease-oriented mask consisting of the position and morphological characteristics. By referencing the disease-oriented similar report and the visual features, the factual consistency model can generate a more accurate radiology report.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are data writing errors in the paper</p></details> |

Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled, image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step toward clinical dialog systems.

| **[On the Existence of Synchrostates in Multichannel EEG Signals during Face-perception Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09791v1)** | 2016-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase synchronisation in multichannel EEG is known as the manifestation of functional brain connectivity. Traditional phase synchronisation studies are mostly based on time average synchrony measures hence do not preserve the temporal evolution of the phase difference. Here we propose a new method to show the existence of a small set of unique phase synchronised patterns or "states" in multi-channel EEG recordings, each "state" being stable of the order of ms, from typical and pathological subjects during face perception tasks. The proposed methodology bridges the concepts of EEG microstates and phase synchronisation in time and frequency domain respectively. The analysis is reported for four groups of children including typical, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), low and high anxiety subjects - a total of 44 subjects. In all cases, we observe consistent existence of these states - termed as synchrostates - within specific cognition related frequency bands (beta and gamma bands), though the topographies of these synchrostates differ for different subject groups with different pathological conditions. The inter-synchrostate switching follows a well-defined sequence capturing the underlying inter-electrode phase relation dynamics in stimulus- and person-centric manner. Our study is motivated from the well-known EEG microstate exhibiting stable potential maps over the scalp. However, here we report a similar observation of quasi-stable phase synchronised states in multichannel EEG. The existence of the synchrostates coupled with their unique switching sequence characteristics could be considered as a potentially new field over contemporary EEG phase synchronisation studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose MDNet to establish a direct multimodal mapping between medical images and diagnostic reports that can read images, generate diagnostic reports, retrieve images by symptom descriptions, and visualize attention, to provide justifications of the network diagnosis process. MDNet includes an image model and a language model. The image model is proposed to enhance multi-scale feature ensembles and utilization efficiency. The language model, integrated with our improved attention mechanism, aims to read and explore discriminative image feature descriptions from reports to learn a direct mapping from sentence words to image pixels. The overall network is trained end-to-end by using our developed optimization strategy. Based on a pathology bladder cancer images and its diagnostic reports (BCIDR) dataset, we conduct sufficient experiments to demonstrate that MDNet outperforms comparative baselines. The proposed image model obtains state-of-the-art performance on two CIFAR datasets as well.</p></details> | CVPR2017 Oral |
| **[Automatic Vertebra Localization and Identification in CT by Spine Rectification and Anatomically-constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07947v1)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vertebra localization and identification are required in many clinical applications of spine disorder diagnosis and surgery planning. However, significant challenges are posed in this task by highly varying pathologies (such as vertebral compression fracture, scoliosis, and vertebral fixation) and imaging conditions (such as limited field of view and metal streak artifacts). This paper proposes a robust and accurate method that effectively exploits the anatomical knowledge of the spine to facilitate vertebra localization and identification. A key point localization model is trained to produce activation maps of vertebra centers. They are then re-sampled along the spine centerline to produce spine-rectified activation maps, which are further aggregated into 1-D activation signals. Following this, an anatomically-constrained optimization module is introduced to jointly search for the optimal vertebra centers under a soft constraint that regulates the distance between vertebrae and a hard constraint on the consecutive vertebra indices. When being evaluated on a major public benchmark of 302 highly pathological CT images, the proposed method reports the state of the art identification (id.) rate of 97.4%, and outperforms the best competing method of 94.7% id. rate by reducing the relative id. error rate by half.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountPath: Automating Fragment Counting in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10520v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality control of medical images is a critical component of digital pathology, ensuring that diagnostic images meet required standards. A pre-analytical task within this process is the verification of the number of specimen fragments, a process that ensures that the number of fragments on a slide matches the number documented in the macroscopic report. This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting. Additionally, we present findings on interobserver variability, showing that the automated approach achieves an accuracy of 86%, which falls within the range of variation observed among experts (82-88%), further supporting its potential for integration into routine pathology workflows.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

We exemplify the design space on a model embodying cardiovascular pathologies, represented by a mechanism where a liquid is pumped into a draining vessel, with complications illustrated through modifications to the model. The results of a mixed-methods lab study with 28 participants show that both physical manifestation and manual operation have a strong positive impact on the audience's engagement. The study does not show a measurable knowledge increase with respect to cardiovascular pathologies using manually operated physical representations. However, subjectively, participants report a better understanding of the process-mainly through non-visual cues like haptics, but also auditory cues. The study also indicates an increased task load when interacting with the process, which, however, seems to play a minor role for the participants. Overall, the study shows a clear potential of physicalization for the communication of complex dynamic processes, which only fully unfold if observers have to chance to interact with the process.</p></details> |  |

The radiologists examining these spinal scans naturally focus on spinal pathologies and might miss other types of abnormalities, and in particular, abdominal ones, such as malignancies. Nevertheless, the patients whose spine was scanned might as well have malignant and other abdominal pathologies. Thus, clinicians have suggested the need for computerized assistance and decision support in screening spinal scans for additional abnormalities. In the current study, We have addressed the important case of detecting suspicious lesions in the adrenal glands as an example for the overall methodology we have developed. A patient CT scan is integrated from multiple slices with an axial orientation. Our method determines whether a patient has an abnormal adrenal gland, and localises the abnormality if it exists. Our method is composed of three deep learning models; each model has a different task for achieving the final goal. We call our compound method the Multi Model Graph Aggregation MMGA method. The novelty in this study is twofold. First, the use, for an important screening task, of CT scans that are originally focused and tuned for imaging the spine, which were acquired from patients with potential spinal disorders, for detection of a totally different set of abnormalities such as abdominal Adrenal glands pathologies. Second, we have built a complex pipeline architecture composed from three deep learning models that can be utilized for other organs (such as the pancreas or the kidney), or for similar applications, but using other types of imaging, such as MRI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Image Generation with Diffusion Models and Cross Class Label Learning for Polyp Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05444v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologic diagnosis is a critical phase in deciding the optimal treatment procedure for dealing with colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/Vanshali/PathoPolyp-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Supervision of Histopathology Improves Prostate Cancer Classification from MRI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06336v1)** | 2022-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-invasive prostate cancer detection from MRI has the potential to revolutionize patient care by providing early detection of clinically-significant disease (ISUP grade group >= 2), but has thus far shown limited positive predictive value. To address this, we present an MRI-based deep learning method for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer applicable to a patient population with subsequent ground truth biopsy results ranging from benign pathology to ISUP grade group~5. Specifically, we demonstrate that mixed supervision via diverse histopathological ground truth improves classification performance despite the cost of reduced concordance with image-based segmentation. That is, where prior approaches have utilized pathology results as ground truth derived from targeted biopsies and whole-mount prostatectomy to strongly supervise the localization of clinically significant cancer, our approach also utilizes weak supervision signals extracted from nontargeted systematic biopsies with regional localization to improve overall performance. Our key innovation is performing regression by distribution rather than simply by value, enabling use of additional pathology findings traditionally ignored by deep learning strategies. We evaluated our model on a dataset of 973 (testing n=160) multi-parametric prostate MRI exams collected at UCSF from 2015-2018 followed by MRI/ultrasound fusion (targeted) biopsy and systematic (nontargeted) biopsy of the prostate gland, demonstrating that deep networks trained with mixed supervision of histopathology can significantly exceed the performance of the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) clinical standard for prostate MRI interpretation.</p></details> |  |

DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment, chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement tuning with clinical reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and fluency. On the MIMIC-CXR benchmark, DiagCoT improved zero-shot disease classification AUC from 0.52 to 0.76 (absolute gain of 0.24), pathology grounding mIoU from 0.08 to 0.31 (absolute gain of 0.23), and report generation BLEU from 0.11 to 0.33 (absolute gain of 0.22). It outperformed state-of-the-art models including LLaVA-Med and CXR-LLAVA on long-tailed diseases and external datasets. By converting unstructured clinical narratives into structured supervision, DiagCoT offers a scalable approach for developing interpretable and diagnostically competent AI systems for radiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple verification in computational modeling of bone pathologies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.1368v1)** | 2011-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a model checking approach to diagnose the emerging of bone pathologies. The implementation of a new model of bone remodeling in PRISM has led to an interesting characterization of osteoporosis as a defective bone remodeling dynamics with respect to other bone pathologies. Our approach allows to derive three types of model checking-based diagnostic estimators. The first diagnostic measure focuses on the level of bone mineral density, which is currently used in medical practice. In addition, we have introduced a novel diagnostic estimator which uses the full patient clinical record, here simulated using the modeling framework. This estimator detects rapid (months) negative changes in bone mineral density. Independently of the actual bone mineral density, when the decrease occurs rapidly it is important to alarm the patient and monitor him/her more closely to detect insurgence of other bone co-morbidities. A third estimator takes into account the variance of the bone density, which could address the investigation of metabolic syndromes, diabetes and cancer. Our implementation could make use of different logical combinations of these statistical estimators and could incorporate other biomarkers for other systemic co-morbidities (for example diabetes and thalassemia). We are delighted to report that the combination of stochastic modeling with formal methods motivate new diagnostic framework for complex pathologies. In particular our approach takes into consideration important properties of biosystems such as multiscale and self-adaptiveness. The multi-diagnosis could be further expanded, inching towards the complexity of human diseases. Finally, we briefly introduce self-adaptiveness in formal methods which is a key property in the regulative mechanisms of biological systems and well known in other mathematical and engineering areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings CompMod 2011, arXiv:1109.1044</p></details> |
| **[Are the Majority of Public Computational Notebooks Pathologically Non-Executable?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04184v4)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks are the de facto platforms for exploratory data science, offering an interactive programming environment where users can create, modify, and execute code cells in any sequence. However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |

We developed fine-tuned language models (LMs) to classify brain MRI reports as normal (reports with limited pathology) or abnormal, fine-tuning BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and RadBERT on 44,661 reports. We also explored the reasoning capabilities of a leading LM, Gemini 1.5-Pro, for normal report categorization. Automated image processing and modeling generated brain growth charts from LM-classified normal scans, comparing them to human-derived charts. Fine-tuned LMs achieved high classification performance (F1-Score >97%), with unbalanced training mitigating class imbalance. Performance was robust on out-of-distribution data, with full text outperforming summary (impression) sections. Gemini 1.5-Pro showed a promising categorization performance, especially with clinical inference. LM-derived brain growth charts were nearly identical to human-annotated charts (r = 0.99, p < 2.2e-16). Our LMs offer scalable analysis of radiology reports, enabling automated classification of brain MRIs in large datasets. One application is automated generation of brain growth charts for benchmarking quantitative image features. Further research is needed to address data heterogeneity and optimize LM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, the direct generation of radiology graphs from chest X-ray (CXR) images has not been attempted. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach called Prior-RadGraphFormer that utilizes a transformer model with prior knowledge in the form of a probabilistic knowledge graph (PKG) to generate radiology graphs directly from CXR images. The PKG models the statistical relationship between radiology entities, including anatomical structures and medical observations. This additional contextual information enhances the accuracy of entity and relation extraction. The generated radiology graphs can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as free-text or structured reports generation and multi-label classification of pathologies. Our approach represents a promising method for generating radiology graphs directly from CXR images, and has significant potential for improving medical image analysis and clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>In GR...</summary><p>In GRAIL @ MICCAI 2023</p></details> |

A recent line of work has focused on automatically generating reports with NLP methods. However, different audiences have different purposes when writing/reading medical reports -- for example, healthcare professionals care more about pathology, whereas patients are more concerned with the diagnosis ("Is there any abnormality?"). The expectation gap results in a common situation where patients find their medical reports to be ambiguous and therefore unsure about the next steps. In this work, we explore the audience expectation gap in healthcare and summarize common ambiguities that lead patients to be confused about their diagnosis into three categories: medical jargon, contradictory findings, and misleading grammatical errors. Based on our analysis, we define a disambiguation rewriting task to regenerate an input to be unambiguous while preserving information about the original content. We further propose a rewriting algorithm based on contrastive pretraining and perturbation-based rewriting. In addition, we create two datasets, OpenI-Annotated based on chest reports and VA-Annotated based on general medical reports, with available binary labels for ambiguity and abnormality presence annotated by radiology specialists. Experimental results on these datasets show that our proposed algorithm effectively rewrites input sentences in a less ambiguous way with high content fidelity. Our code and annotated data are released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2023. 13 pages including 4-page supplementary materials</p></details> |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18449v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |
| **[Systematic Evaluation of Preprocessing Techniques for Accurate Image Registration in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04171v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method, which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values (AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Smart Chest X-ray Worklist Prioritization using Artificial Intelligence: A Clinical Workflow Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08625v2)** | 2020-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim is to evaluate whether smart worklist prioritization by artificial intelligence (AI) can optimize the radiology workflow and reduce report turnaround times (RTAT) for critical findings in chest radiographs (CXRs). Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative predictions by AI -- resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist. We developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a university hospital by incorporating hospital specific CXR generation rates, reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the standard worklist processing "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) and compared it with a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass and foreign object. Furthermore, we introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest urgency is assigned to the examination. The average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all Prioritization-simulations compared to the FIFO-simulation (e.g. pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 80.1 min; p $<0.0001$), while the maximum RTAT for most findings increased at the same time (e.g. pneumothorax: 1293 min vs 890 min; p $<0.0001$). Our "upper limit" substantially reduced the maximum RTAT all classes (e.g. pneumothorax: 979 min vs. 1293 min / 1178 min; p $<0.0001$). Our simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small maximum RTAT as FIFO.</p></details> |  |

The key features of the BIRL framework are: easily extendable, performance evaluation, parallel experimentation, simple visualisations, experiment's time-out limit, resuming unfinished experiments. From the research practice, we identified and focused on these two main use-cases: (a) comparison of user's (newly developed) method with some State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods on a common dataset and (b) experimenting SOTA methods on user's custom dataset (which should contain landmark annotation). Moreover, we present an integration of several standard image registration methods aiming at biomedical imaging into the BIRL framework.

Furthermore, we explore the use of the newer EfficientNet model, improving the accuracy to 0.962. Finally, we introduce the state-of-the-art idea of semi-supervised Noisy Student training to the EfficientNet, resulting in significant improvements in both accuracy and convergence rate. The final ensembled Noisy Student model performs very well on the task, achieving a test score of 0.982.</p></details> |  |

We present CheXpert, a large dataset that contains 224,316 chest radiographs of 65,240 patients. We design a labeler to automatically detect the presence of 14 observations in radiology reports, capturing uncertainties inherent in radiograph interpretation. We investigate different approaches to using the uncertainty labels for training convolutional neural networks that output the probability of these observations given the available frontal and lateral radiographs. On a validation set of 200 chest radiographic studies which were manually annotated by 3 board-certified radiologists, we find that different uncertainty approaches are useful for different pathologies. We then evaluate our best model on a test set composed of 500 chest radiographic studies annotated by a consensus of 5 board-certified radiologists, and compare the performance of our model to that of 3 additional radiologists in the detection of 5 selected pathologies. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model ROC and PR curves lie above all 3 radiologist operating points. We release the dataset to the public as a standard benchmark to evaluate performance of chest radiograph interpretation models.

Variability in polyp characterization among pathologists also hinders consistent surveillance decisions. Advances in digital pathology and deep learning enable the integration of pathology slides and medical records for more accurate CRC risk prediction. Using data from the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry, including longitudinal follow-up, we adapted a transformer-based model for histopathology image analysis to predict 5-year CRC risk. We further explored multi-modal fusion strategies to combine clinical records with deep learning-derived image features. Training the model to predict intermediate clinical variables improved 5-year CRC risk prediction (AUC = 0.630) compared to direct prediction (AUC = 0.615, p = 0.013). Incorporating both imaging and non-imaging data, without requiring manual slide review, further improved performance (AUC = 0.674) compared to traditional features from colonoscopy and microscopy reports (AUC = 0.655, p = 0.001). These results highlight the value of integrating diverse data modalities with computational methods to enhance CRC risk stratification.</p></details> |  |

We aimed to investigate the performance of an institutionally developed system for prostate cancer detection, grading, and workflow optimization and to contrast this with commercial alternatives. From August 2021 to March 2023, we scanned 21,396 slides from 1,147 patients receiving prostate biopsy. We developed models for cancer detection, grading, and screening of equivocal cases for IHC ordering. We compared the performance of task-specific prostate models with general-purpose foundation models in a prospectively collected dataset that reflects our patient population. We also evaluated the contributions of a bespoke model designed to improve sensitivity to small cancer foci and perception of low-resolution patterns. We found high concordance with pathologist ground-truth in detection (area under curve 98.5%, sensitivity 95.0%, and specificity 97.8%), ISUP grading (Cohen's kappa 0.869), grade group 3 or higher classification (area under curve 97.5%, sensitivity 94.9%, specificity 96.6%). Screening models could correctly classify 55% of biopsy blocks where immunohistochemistry was ordered with a 1.4% error rate. No statistically significant differences were observed between task-specific and foundation models in cancer detection, although the task-specific model is significantly smaller and faster. Institutions like academic medical centers that have high scanning volumes and report abstraction capabilities can develop highly accurate computational pathology models for internal use. These models have the potential to aid in quality control role and to improve resource allocation and workflow in the pathology lab to help meet future challenges in prostate cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating Intervention Discovery from Scientific Literature: A Progressive Ontology Prompting and Dual-LLM Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00054v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying effective interventions from the scientific literature is challenging due to the high volume of publications, specialized terminology, and inconsistent reporting formats, making manual curation laborious and prone to oversight. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs), which integrates a progressive ontology prompting (POP) algorithm with a dual-agent system, named LLM-Duo. On the one hand, the POP algorithm conducts a prioritized breadth-first search (BFS) across a predefined ontology, generating structured prompt templates and action sequences to guide the automatic annotation process. On the other hand, the LLM-Duo system features two specialized LLM agents, an explorer and an evaluator, working collaboratively and adversarially to continuously refine annotation quality. We showcase the real-world applicability of our framework through a case study focused on speech-language intervention discovery. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses advanced baselines, achieving more accurate and comprehensive annotations through a fully automated process. Our approach successfully identified 2,421 interventions from a corpus of 64,177 research articles in the speech-language pathology domain, culminating in the creation of a publicly accessible intervention knowledge base with great potential to benefit the speech-language pathology community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |

These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid focus map surveying for whole slide imaging with continues sample motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03039v1)** | 2019-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide imaging (WSI) has recently been cleared for primary diagnosis in the US. A critical challenge of WSI is to perform accurate focusing in high speed. Traditional systems create a focus map prior to scanning. For each focus point on the map, sample needs to be static in the x-y plane and axial scanning is needed to maximize the contrast. Here we report a novel focus map surveying method for WSI. The reported method requires no axial scanning, no additional camera and lens, works for stained and transparent samples, and allows continuous sample motion in the surveying process. It can be used for both brightfield and fluorescence WSI. By using a 20X, 0.75 NA objective lens, we demonstrate a mean focusing error of ~0.08 microns in the static mode and ~0.17 microns in the continuous motion mode. The reported method may provide a turnkey solution for most existing WSI systems for its simplicity, robustness, accuracy, and high-speed. It may also standardize the imaging performance of WSI systems for digital pathology and find other applications in high-content microscopy such as DNA sequencing and time-lapse live-cell imaging.</p></details> |  |

The compression approach was tested on more common computer vision datasets such as CIFAR10, and we explore which image characteristics enable this compression ratio on cancer imaging data but not generic images. We generate and visualize embeddings from the compressed latent space and demonstrate how they are useful for clinical interpretation of data, and how in the future such latent embeddings can be used to accelerate search of clinical imaging data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Yottixel -- An Image Search Engine for Large Archives of Histopathology Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08748v1)** | 2019-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the emergence of digital pathology, searching for similar images in large archives has gained considerable attention. Image retrieval can provide pathologists with unprecedented access to the evidence embodied in already diagnosed and treated cases from the past. This paper proposes a search engine specialized for digital pathology, called Yottixel, a portmanteau for "one yotta pixel," alluding to the big-data nature of histopathology images. The most impressive characteristic of Yottixel is its ability to represent whole slide images (WSIs) in a compact manner. Yottixel can perform millions of searches in real-time with a high search accuracy and low storage profile. Yottixel uses an intelligent indexing algorithm capable of representing WSIs with a mosaic of patches by converting them into a small number of methodically extracted barcodes, called "Bunch of Barcodes" (BoB), the most prominent performance enabler of Yottixel. The performance of the prototype platform is qualitatively tested using 300 WSIs from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and 2,020 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) provided by the National Cancer Institute. Both datasets amount to more than 4,000,000 patches of 1000x1000 pixels. We report three sets of experiments that show that Yottixel can accurately retrieve organs and malignancies, and its semantic ordering shows good agreement with the subjective evaluation of human observers.</p></details> |  |

Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |
| **[Anatomy-Guided Radiology Report Generation with Pathology-Aware Regional Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10789v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology reporting generative AI holds significant potential to alleviate clinical workloads and streamline medical care. However, achieving high clinical accuracy is challenging, as radiological images often feature subtle lesions and intricate structures. Existing systems often fall short, largely due to their reliance on fixed size, patch-level image features and insufficient incorporation of pathological information. This can result in the neglect of such subtle patterns and inconsistent descriptions of crucial pathologies. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative approach that leverages pathology-aware regional prompts to explicitly integrate anatomical and pathological information of various scales, significantly enhancing the precision and clinical relevance of generated reports. We develop an anatomical region detector that extracts features from distinct anatomical areas, coupled with a novel multi-label lesion detector that identifies global pathologies. Our approach emulates the diagnostic process of radiologists, producing clinically accurate reports with comprehensive diagnostic capabilities. Experimental results show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on most natural language generation and clinical efficacy metrics, with formal expert evaluations affirming its potential to enhance radiology practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

| **[See Detail Say Clear: Towards Brain CT Report Generation via Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19676v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain CT report generation is significant to aid physicians in diagnosing cranial diseases. Recent studies concentrate on handling the consistency between visual and textual pathological features to improve the coherence of report. However, there exist some challenges: 1) Redundant visual representing: Massive irrelevant areas in 3D scans distract models from representing salient visual contexts. 2) Shifted semantic representing: Limited medical corpus causes difficulties for models to transfer the learned textual representations to generative layers. This study introduces a Pathological Clue-driven Representation Learning (PCRL) model to build cross-modal representations based on pathological clues and naturally adapt them for accurate report generation. Specifically, we construct pathological clues from perspectives of segmented regions, pathological entities, and report themes, to fully grasp visual pathological patterns and learn cross-modal feature representations. To adapt the representations for the text generation task, we bridge the gap between representation learning and report generation by using a unified large language model (LLM) with task-tailored instructions. These crafted instructions enable the LLM to be flexibly fine-tuned across tasks and smoothly transfer the semantic representation for report generation. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods and achieves SoTA performance.

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |
| **[PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.10536v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |

This lead to the current generalized standards that are being continuously updated as new findings are reported. It is noticeable that these effective standards are developed based on a multi-source heterogeneous data, including whole-slide images and pathology and clinical reports. In this study, we propose a framework that combines pathological images and medical reports to generate a personalized diagnosis result for individual patient. We use nuclei-level image feature similarity and content-based deep learning method to search for a personalized group of population with similar pathological characteristics, extract structured prognostic information from descriptive pathology reports of the similar patient population, and assign importance of different prognostic factors to generate a personalized pathological diagnosis result. We use multi-source heterogeneous data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. The result demonstrate that our framework matches the performance of pathologists in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma.

While recent vision-language models achieve strong results in general radiology report generation, they often fail to adequately describe rare but clinically important pathologies like fractures. This work addresses this gap by developing specialized models for fracture pathology detection and description. We train fracture-specific vision-language models with encoders from MAIRA-2 and CheXagent, demonstrating significant improvements over general-purpose models in generating accurate fracture descriptions. Analysis of model outputs by fracture type, location, and age reveals distinct strengths and limitations of current vision-language model architectures. We publicly release our best-performing fracture-reporting model, facilitating future research in accurate reporting of rare pathologies.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

The unstructured nature of these reports presents a significant challenge limiting the accessibility of their content. In this work, we present a practical approach based on the use of large multimodal models (LMMs) for automatically extracting information from scanned images of pathology reports with the goal of generating a standardised report specifying the value of different fields along with estimated confidence about the accuracy of the extracted fields. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods which do not assign confidence scores to extracted fields limiting their practical use. The proposed framework uses two stages of prompting a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for information extraction and validation. The framework generalises to textual reports from multiple medical centres as well as scanned images of legacy pathology reports. We show that the estimated confidence is an effective indicator of the accuracy of the extracted information that can be used to select only accurately extracted fields. We also show the prognostic significance of structured and unstructured data from pathology reports and show that the automatically extracted field values significant prognostic value for patient stratification. The framework is available for evaluation via the URL: https://labieb.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 tables and 6 figures</p></details> |

However, manually writing detailed reports brings heavy workloads for pathologists. To improve efficiency, some existing works have studied automatic generation of cytopathology reports, mainly by applying image caption generation frameworks with visual encoders originally proposed for natural images. A common weakness of these works is that they do not explicitly model the structural information among cells, which is a key feature of pathology images and provides significant information for making diagnoses. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based framework called GNNFormer, which seamlessly integrates graph neural network (GNN) and Transformer into the same framework, for cytopathology report generation. To the best of our knowledge, GNNFormer is the first report generation method that explicitly models the structural information among cells in pathology images. It also effectively fuses structural information among cells, fine-grained morphology features of cells and background features to generate high-quality reports. Experimental results on the NMI-WSI dataset show that GNNFormer can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Knowledge Graph Construction and Its Application in Automatic Radiology Report Generation from Radiologist's Dictation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06308v2)** | 2022-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventionally, the radiologist prepares the diagnosis notes and shares them with the transcriptionist. Then the transcriptionist prepares a preliminary formatted report referring to the notes, and finally, the radiologist reviews the report, corrects the errors, and signs off. This workflow causes significant delays and errors in the report. In current research work, we focus on applications of NLP techniques like Information Extraction (IE) and domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) to automatically generate radiology reports from radiologist's dictation. This paper focuses on KG construction for each organ by extracting information from an existing large corpus of free-text radiology reports. We develop an information extraction pipeline that combines rule-based, pattern-based, and dictionary-based techniques with lexical-semantic features to extract entities and relations. Missing information in short dictation can be accessed from the KGs to generate pathological descriptions and hence the radiology report. Generated pathological descriptions evaluated using semantic similarity metrics, which shows 97% similarity with gold standard pathological descriptions. Also, our analysis shows that our IE module is performing better than the OpenIE tool for the radiology domain. Furthermore, we include a manual qualitative analysis from radiologists, which shows that 80-85% of the generated reports are correctly written, and the remaining are partially correct.</p></details> |  |
| **[Replace and Report: NLP Assisted Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.17180v1)** | 2023-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical practice frequently uses medical imaging for diagnosis and treatment. A significant challenge for automatic radiology report generation is that the radiology reports are long narratives consisting of multiple sentences for both abnormal and normal findings. Therefore, applying conventional image captioning approaches to generate the whole report proves to be insufficient, as these are designed to briefly describe images with short sentences. We propose a template-based approach to generate radiology reports from radiographs. Our approach involves the following: i) using a multilabel image classifier, produce the tags for the input radiograph; ii) using a transformer-based model, generate pathological descriptions (a description of abnormal findings seen on radiographs) from the tags generated in step (i); iii) using a BERT-based multi-label text classifier, find the spans in the normal report template to replace with the generated pathological descriptions; and iv) using a rule-based system, replace the identified span with the generated pathological description. We performed experiments with the two most popular radiology report datasets, IU Chest X-ray and MIMIC-CXR and demonstrated that the BLEU-1, ROUGE-L, METEOR, and CIDEr scores are better than the State-of-the-Art models by 25%, 36%, 44% and 48% respectively, on the IU X-RAY dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to generate chest X-ray radiology reports by first creating small sentences for abnormal findings and then replacing them in the normal report template.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 6...</summary><p>The 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics</p></details> |

Additionally, semantic agnostic feature extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions. Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process. Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in radiology report generation.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

In this letter, we compare the performance of some known application program interface (APIs) for the task of thoracic abnormality extraction from radiology reports. We explored several medical domain specific annotation tools like Medical Text Indexer(MTI) with Non-MEDLINE and Mesh On Demand(MOD) options and generic Natural Language Understanding (NLU) API provided by the IBM cloud. Our results show that although MTI and MOD are intended for extracting medical terms, their performance is worst compared to generic extraction API like IBM NLU. Finally, we trained a DNN-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract the key concept words from radiology reports. Our model outperforms the medical specific and generic API performance by a large margin. Our results demonstrate the inadequacy of generic APIs for pathology extraction task and establish the importance of domain specific model training for improved results. We hope that these results motivate the research community to release larger de-identified radiology reports corpus for building high accuracy machine learning models for the important task of pathology extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

| **[Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation for Automated Structured Data Extraction from Diagnostic Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10576v2)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To develop and evaluate an automated system for extracting structured clinical information from unstructured radiology and pathology reports using open-weights large language models (LMs) and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and to assess the effects of model configuration variables on extraction performance. Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows, highlighting the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare data extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathAlign: A vision-language model for whole slide images in histopathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19578v1)** | 2024-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages and 19 pages of supplemental material; 3 main tables, 3 main figures and 11 supplemental tables, 7 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |

Recent efforts have utilized pre-trained contrastive image-text models like CLIP, adapting them for medical use by fine-tuning the model with chest X-ray images and corresponding reports for zero-shot pathology classification, thus eliminating the need for pathology-specific annotations. However, most studies continue to use the same contrastive learning objectives as in the general domain, overlooking the multi-labeled nature of medical image-report pairs. In this paper, we propose a new fine-tuning strategy that includes positive-pair loss relaxation and random sentence sampling. We aim to improve the performance of zero-shot pathology classification without relying on external knowledge. Our method can be applied to any pre-trained contrastive image-text encoder and easily transferred to out-of-domain datasets without further training, as it does not use external data. Our approach consistently improves overall zero-shot pathology classification across four chest X-ray datasets and three pre-trained models, with an average macro AUROC increase of 4.3%. Additionally, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art and marginally surpasses board-certified radiologists in zero-shot classification for the five competition pathologies in the CheXpert dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, successful text mining of a large pathology database can play a critical role to advance 'big data' cancer research like similarity-based treatment selection, case identification, prognostication, surveillance, clinical trial screening, risk stratification, and many others. While there is a growing interest in developing language models for more specific clinical domains, no pathology-specific language space exist to support the rapid data-mining development in pathology space. In literature, a few approaches fine-tuned general transformer models on specialized corpora while maintaining the original tokenizer, but in fields requiring specialized terminology, these models often fail to perform adequately. We propose PathologyBERT - a pre-trained masked language model which was trained on 347,173 histopathology specimen reports and publicly released in the Huggingface repository.

To overcome data-scarcity in computational pathology, recent studies exploit transfer learning to reuse knowledge gained from natural images in pathology image analysis, aiming to build effective pathology image diagnosis models. Since transferability of knowledge heavily depends on the similarity of the original and target tasks, significant differences in image content and statistics between pathology images and natural images raise the questions: how much knowledge is transferable? Is the transferred information equally contributed by pre-trained layers? To answer these questions, this paper proposes a framework to quantify knowledge gain by a particular layer, conducts an empirical investigation in pathology image centered transfer learning, and reports some interesting observations. Particularly, compared to the performance baseline obtained by random-weight model, though transferability of off-the-shelf representations from deep layers heavily depend on specific pathology image sets, the general representation generated by early layers does convey transferred knowledge in various image classification applications. The observation in this study encourages further investigation of specific metric and tools to quantify effectiveness and feasibility of transfer learning in future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exper...</summary><p>Experimentation data correction</p></details> |

While pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore, ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from 20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification, biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across 27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks, including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade tasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation underline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward more efficient and high-quality medical services.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |

This can be notably prohibitive for models in specialized domains, such as computational pathology. Conditioning on labeled data is known to help in data-efficient model training. Therefore, histopathology reports, which are rich in valuable clinical information, are an ideal choice as guidance for a histopathology generative model. In this paper, we introduce PathLDM, the first text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model tailored for generating high-quality histopathology images. Leveraging the rich contextual information provided by pathology text reports, our approach fuses image and textual data to enhance the generation process. By utilizing GPT's capabilities to distill and summarize complex text reports, we establish an effective conditioning mechanism. Through strategic conditioning and necessary architectural enhancements, we achieved a SoTA FID score of 7.64 for text-to-image generation on the TCGA-BRCA dataset, significantly outperforming the closest text-conditioned competitor with FID 30.1.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2024 publication</p></details> |

Using past radiological reports obtained from hospital archiving systems has many advantages as training data above manual single-class labels: they are expert annotations available in large quantities, covering a population-representative variety of pathologies, and they provide additional context to pathology diagnoses, such as anatomical location and severity. Learning to auto-generate such reports from images present many challenges such as the difficulty in representing and generating long, unstructured textual information, accounting for spelling errors and repetition/redundancy, and the inconsistency across different annotators. We therefore propose to first learn visually-informative medical concepts from raw reports, and, using the concept predictions as image annotations, learn to auto-generate structured reports directly from images. We validate our approach on the OpenI [2] chest x-ray dataset, which consists of frontal and lateral views of chest x-ray images, their corresponding raw textual reports and manual medical subject heading (MeSH ) annotations made by radiologists.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI ML-CDS Workshop 2019</p></details> |

Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc is extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts with abundant image features to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies without the reliance on expert image annotations. We conduct primary experiments on a dataset of 220K pairs of image-report chest X-ray images and perform validation across eight external datasets encompassing 34 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both annotation-free localization and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of AFLoc on other modalities, including histopathology and retinal fundus images. We show that AFLoc exhibits robust generalization capabilities, even surpassing human benchmarks in localizing five different types of pathological images. These results highlight the potential of AFLoc in reducing annotation requirements and its applicability in complex clinical environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models in Computational Pathology: A Review of Challenges, Opportunities, and Impact](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08333v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From self-supervised, vision-only models to contrastive visual-language frameworks, computational pathology has rapidly evolved in recent years. Generative AI "co-pilots" now demonstrate the ability to mine subtle, sub-visual tissue cues across the cellular-to-pathology spectrum, generate comprehensive reports, and respond to complex user queries. The scale of data has surged dramatically, growing from tens to millions of multi-gigapixel tissue images, while the number of trainable parameters in these models has risen to several billion. The critical question remains: how will this new wave of generative and multi-purpose AI transform clinical diagnostics? In this article, we explore the true potential of these innovations and their integration into clinical practice. We review the rapid progress of foundation models in pathology, clarify their applications and significance. More precisely, we examine the very definition of foundational models, identifying what makes them foundational, general, or multipurpose, and assess their impact on computational pathology. Additionally, we address the unique challenges associated with their development and evaluation. These models have demonstrated exceptional predictive and generative capabilities, but establishing global benchmarks is crucial to enhancing evaluation standards and fostering their widespread clinical adoption. In computational pathology, the broader impact of frontier AI ultimately depends on widespread adoption and societal acceptance. While direct public exposure is not strictly necessary, it remains a powerful tool for dispelling misconceptions, building trust, and securing regulatory support.</p></details> | 63 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Multimodal Multitask Representation Learning for Pathology Biobank Metadata Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07846v1)** | 2019-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[DiagR1: A Vision-Language Model Trained via Reinforcement Learning for Digestive Pathology Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18433v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[VICCA: Visual Interpretation and Comprehension of Chest X-ray Anomalies in Generated Report Without Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17726v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly central to healthcare, the demand for explainable and trustworthy models is paramount. Current report generation systems for chest X-rays (CXR) often lack mechanisms for validating outputs without expert oversight, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the semantic alignment and localization accuracy of AI-generated medical reports. Our framework integrates two key modules: a Phrase Grounding Model, which identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images based on textual prompts, and a Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, which generates synthetic CXR images from prompts while preserving anatomical fidelity. By comparing features between the original and generated images, we introduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy, while the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment. The integration of phrase grounding with diffusion models, coupled with the dual-scoring evaluation system, provides a robust mechanism for validating report quality, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

The rise of multimodal large models has simplified the process of integrating image analysis with textual descriptions. Despite this advancement, the substantial costs associated with training and deploying these complex multimodal models, together with a scarcity of high-quality training datasets, create a significant divide between cutting-edge technology and its application in the clinical setting. We had meticulously compiled a dataset of approximately 45,000 cases, covering over 6 different tasks, including the classification of organ tissues, generating pathology report descriptions, and addressing pathology-related questions and answers. We have fine-tuned multimodal large models, specifically LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternLM, with this dataset to enhance instruction-based performance. We conducted a qualitative assessment of the capabilities of the base model and the fine-tuned model in performing image captioning and classification tasks on the specific dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits proficiency in addressing typical pathological questions. We hope that by making both our models and datasets publicly available, they can be valuable to the medical and research communities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Automated Glaucoma Report Generation via Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM and Multimodal Clinical Data Integration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10037v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI for automated glaucoma diagnostic report generation faces two predominant challenges: content redundancy in narrative outputs and inadequate highlighting of pathologically significant features including optic disc cupping, retinal nerve fiber layer defects, and visual field abnormalities. These limitations primarily stem from current multimodal architectures' insufficient capacity to extract discriminative structural-textural patterns from fundus imaging data while maintaining precise semantic alignment with domain-specific terminology in comprehensive clinical reports. To overcome these constraints, we present the Dual-Attention Semantic Parallel-LSTM Network (DA-SPL), an advanced multimodal generation framework that synergistically processes both fundus imaging and supplementary visual inputs. DA-SPL employs an Encoder-Decoder structure augmented with the novel joint dual-attention mechanism in the encoder for cross-modal feature refinement, the parallelized LSTM decoder architecture for enhanced temporal-semantic consistency, and the specialized label enhancement module for accurate disease-relevant term generation. Rigorous evaluation on standard glaucoma datasets demonstrates DA-SPL's consistent superiority over state-of-the-art models across quantitative metrics. DA-SPL exhibits exceptional capability in extracting subtle pathological indicators from multimodal inputs while generating diagnostically precise reports that exhibit strong concordance with clinical expert annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE 25th BIBE</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Elicitation with Large Language Models for Interpretable Cancer Stage Identification from Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01052v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer staging is critical for patient prognosis and treatment planning, yet extracting pathologic TNM staging from unstructured pathology reports poses a persistent challenge. Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG), employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited annotated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[SGSeg: Enabling Text-free Inference in Language-guided Segmentation of Chest X-rays via Self-guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04758v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation of infected areas in chest X-rays is pivotal for facilitating the accurate delineation of pulmonary structures and pathological anomalies. Recently, multi-modal language-guided image segmentation methods have emerged as a promising solution for chest X-rays where the clinical text reports, depicting the assessment of the images, are used as guidance. Nevertheless, existing language-guided methods require clinical reports alongside the images, and hence, they are not applicable for use in image segmentation in a decision support context, but rather limited to retrospective image analysis after clinical reporting has been completed. In this study, we propose a self-guided segmentation framework (SGSeg) that leverages language guidance for training (multi-modal) while enabling text-free inference (uni-modal), which is the first that enables text-free inference in language-guided segmentation. We exploit the critical location information of both pulmonary and pathological structures depicted in the text reports and introduce a novel localization-enhanced report generation (LERG) module to generate clinical reports for self-guidance. Our LERG integrates an object detector and a location-based attention aggregator, weakly-supervised by a location-aware pseudo-label extraction module. Extensive experiments on a well-benchmarked QaTa-COV19 dataset demonstrate that our SGSeg achieved superior performance than existing uni-modal segmentation methods and closely matched the state-of-the-art performance of multi-modal language-guided segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvments or corrections</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Self-Consistency: Ensemble Reasoning Boosts Consistency and Accuracy of LLMs in Cancer Staging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13149v1)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) have encouraged their adoption in the healthcare domain where vital clinical information is often contained in unstructured notes. Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms. Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in determining cancer stage, thereby demonstrating the potential to use these models in clinical or other domains where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME'24)</p></details> |
| **[Shadow and Light: Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs for Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03688v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce DRR-RATE, a large-scale synthetic chest X-ray dataset derived from the recently released CT-RATE dataset. DRR-RATE comprises of 50,188 frontal Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) from 21,304 unique patients. Each image is paired with a corresponding radiology text report and binary labels for 18 pathology classes. Given the controllable nature of DRR generation, it facilitates the inclusion of lateral view images and images from any desired viewing position. This opens up avenues for research into new and novel multimodal applications involving paired CT, X-ray images from various views, text, and binary labels. We demonstrate the applicability of DRR-RATE alongside existing large-scale chest X-ray resources, notably the CheXpert dataset and CheXnet model. Experiments demonstrate that CheXnet, when trained and tested on the DRR-RATE dataset, achieves sufficient to high AUC scores for the six common pathologies cited in common literature: Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Lung Lesion, Lung Opacity, and Pleural Effusion. Additionally, CheXnet trained on the CheXpert dataset can accurately identify several pathologies, even when operating out of distribution. This confirms that the generated DRR images effectively capture the essential pathology features from CT images. The dataset and labels are publicly accessible at https://huggingface.co/datasets/farrell236/DRR-RATE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive and Multi-Path Holistically Nested Neural Networks for Pathological Lung Segmentation from CT Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03702v1)** | 2018-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological lung segmentation (PLS) is an important, yet challenging, medical image application due to the wide variability of pathological lung appearance and shape. Because PLS is often a pre-requisite for other imaging analytics, methodological simplicity and generality are key factors in usability. Along those lines, we present a bottom-up deep-learning based approach that is expressive enough to handle variations in appearance, while remaining unaffected by any variations in shape. We incorporate the deeply supervised learning framework, but enhance it with a simple, yet effective, progressive multi-path scheme, which more reliably merges outputs from different network stages. The result is a deep model able to produce finer detailed masks, which we call progressive holistically-nested networks (P-HNNs). Using extensive cross-validation, our method is tested on multi-institutional datasets comprising 929 CT scans (848 publicly available), of pathological lungs, reporting mean dice scores of 0.985 and demonstrating significant qualitative and quantitative improvements over state-of-the art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 4 figures, MICCAI 2007</p></details> |

The spatial augmentation is ordinary used for semantic segmentation. Tumor images under malignant are rare and to annotate the labels of nuclei region takes much time-consuming. We require an effective use of dataset to maximize the segmentation accuracy. It is expected that some augmentation to transform generalized images influence the segmentation performance. We propose a synthetic augmentation using label-to-image translation, mapping from a semantic label with the edge structure to a real image. Exactly this paper deal with stain slides of nuclei in tumor. Actually, we demonstrate several segmentation algorithms applied to the initial dataset that contains real images and labels using synthetic augmentation in order to add their generalized images. We computes and reports that a proposed synthetic augmentation procedure improve their accuracy.</p></details> | 15pages, 12 figures |
| **[Text-Driven Tumor Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18589v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tumor synthesis can generate examples that AI often misses or over-detects, improving AI performance by training on these challenging cases. However, existing synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating images from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack controllability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated tumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing to effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor synthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor characteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the AI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%), tumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and classification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by +8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis process, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic tumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses contrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly reducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this study) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports. Finally, we have developed rigorous tests to evaluate synthetic tumors, including Text-Driven Visual Turing Test and Radiomics Pattern Analysis, showing that our synthetic tumors is realistic and diverse in texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, many pre-training tasks require extra annotations from clinicians, and most of them fail to explicitly guide the model to learn the desired features of different pathologies. In this paper, we utilize Visual Question Answering (VQA) for multimodal pre-training to guide the framework focusing on targeted pathological features. We leverage descriptions in medical reports to design multi-granular question-answer pairs associated with different diseases, which assist the framework in pre-training without requiring extra annotations from experts. We also propose a novel pre-training framework with a quasi-textual feature transformer, a module designed to transform visual features into a quasi-textual space closer to the textual domain via a contrastive learning strategy. This narrows the vision-language gap and facilitates modality alignment. Our framework is applied to four downstream tasks: report generation, classification, segmentation, and detection across five datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

By integrating chest X-ray images and clinical notes, the model aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in resource-limited settings. Methods: The VLM combines visual data from chest X-rays with clinical context to generate detailed, context-aware diagnostic reports. The architecture employs SIGLIP for visual encoding and Gemma-3b for decoding, ensuring effective representation of acute TB-specific pathologies and clinical insights. Results: Key acute TB pathologies, including consolidation, cavities, and nodules, were detected with high precision (97percent) and recall (96percent). The model demonstrated strong spatial localization capabilities and robustness in distinguishing TB-positive cases, making it a reliable tool for acute TB diagnosis. Conclusion: The multimodal capability of the VLM reduces reliance on radiologists, providing a scalable solution for acute TB screening. Future work will focus on improving the detection of subtle pathologies and addressing dataset biases to enhance its generalizability and application in diverse global healthcare settings.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Reading Radiology Imaging Like The Radiologist](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.05921v3)** | 2023-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated radiology report generation aims to generate radiology reports that contain rich, fine-grained descriptions of radiology imaging. Compared with image captioning in the natural image domain, medical images are very similar to each other, with only minor differences in the occurrence of diseases. Given the importance of these minor differences in the radiology report, it is crucial to encourage the model to focus more on the subtle regions of disease occurrence. Secondly, the problem of visual and textual data biases is serious. Not only do normal cases make up the majority of the dataset, but sentences describing areas with pathological changes also constitute only a small part of the paragraph. Lastly, generating medical image reports involves the challenge of long text generation, which requires more expertise and empirical training in medical knowledge. As a result, the difficulty of generating such reports is increased. To address these challenges, we propose a disease-oriented retrieval framework that utilizes similar reports as prior knowledge references. We design a factual consistency captioning generator to generate more accurate and factually consistent disease descriptions. Our framework can find most similar reports for a given disease from the CXR database by retrieving a disease-oriented mask consisting of the position and morphological characteristics. By referencing the disease-oriented similar report and the visual features, the factual consistency model can generate a more accurate radiology report.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are data writing errors in the paper</p></details> |

In this work, we present RadPhi-3, a Small Language Model instruction tuned from Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct with 3.8B parameters to assist with various tasks in radiology workflows. While impression summary generation has been the primary task which has been explored in prior works w.r.t radiology reports of Chest X-rays, we also explore other useful tasks like change summary generation comparing the current radiology report and its prior report, section extraction from radiology reports, tagging the reports with various pathologies and tubes, lines or devices present in them etc. In-addition, instruction tuning RadPhi-3 involved learning from a credible knowledge source used by radiologists, Radiopaedia.org.

Specifically, the authors demonstrate their approach by extracting structured condition codes from pathology reports. The proposed approach utilizes local LLMs, which can be fine-tuned to respond to specific generative instructions and provide structured outputs. The authors collected a dataset of over 150k uncurated surgical pathology reports, containing gross descriptions, final diagnoses, and condition codes. They trained different model architectures, including LLaMA, BERT and LongFormer and evaluated their performance. The results show that the LLaMA-based models significantly outperform BERT-style models across all evaluated metrics, even with extremely reduced precision. The LLaMA models performed especially well with large datasets, demonstrating their ability to handle complex, multi-label tasks. Overall, this work presents an effective approach for utilizing LLMs to perform domain-specific tasks using accessible hardware, with potential applications in the medical domain, where complex data extraction and classification are required.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, Preprint of an article submitted for consideration in Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing \c{opyright} 2024 copyright World Scientific Publishing Company https://www.worldscientific.com/</p></details> |
| **[Gram Barcodes for Histopathology Tissue Texture Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15519v1)** | 2021-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in digital pathology have led to the need for Histopathology Image Retrieval (HIR) systems that search through databases of biopsy images to find similar cases to a given query image. These HIR systems allow pathologists to effortlessly and efficiently access thousands of previously diagnosed cases in order to exploit the knowledge in the corresponding pathology reports. Since HIR systems may have to deal with millions of gigapixel images, the extraction of compact and expressive image features must be available to allow for efficient and accurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the application of Gram barcodes as image features for HIR systems. Unlike most feature generation schemes, Gram barcodes are based on high-order statistics that describe tissue texture by summarizing the correlations between different feature maps in layers of convolutional neural networks. We run HIR experiments on three public datasets using a pre-trained VGG19 network for Gram barcode generation and showcase highly competitive results.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complex semantics of biomedical texts, current methods struggle to align medical images with key pathological findings in unstructured reports. This leads to the misalignment with the target disease's textual representation. In this paper, we introduce a novel VLP framework designed to dissect disease descriptions into their fundamental aspects, leveraging prior knowledge about the visual manifestations of pathologies. This is achieved by consulting a large language model and medical experts. Integrating a Transformer module, our approach aligns an input image with the diverse elements of a disease, generating aspect-centric image representations. By consolidating the matches from each aspect, we improve the compatibility between an image and its associated disease. Additionally, capitalizing on the aspect-oriented representations, we present a dual-head Transformer tailored to process known and unknown diseases, optimizing the comprehensive detection efficacy. Conducting experiments on seven downstream datasets, ours improves the accuracy of recent methods by up to 8.56% and 17.26% for seen and unseen categories, respectively.

Amongst approaches to improve model interpretability, concept-based explanations aim to provide concise and human-understandable explanations of any arbitrary classifier. However, such methods usually require a large amount of manually collected data with concept annotation, which is often scarce in the medical domain. In this paper, we propose Conceptual Counterfactual Explanations for Chest X-ray (CoCoX), which leverages the joint embedding space of an existing vision-language model (VLM) to explain black-box classifier outcomes without the need for annotated datasets. Specifically, we utilize textual concepts derived from chest radiography reports and a pre-trained chest radiography-based VLM to explain three common cardiothoracic pathologies.

Prior to routine use, it is important to evaluate their predictive performance and obtain regulatory approval. This assessment requires appropriate test datasets. However, compiling such datasets is challenging and specific recommendations are missing. A committee of various stakeholders, including commercial AI developers, pathologists, and researchers, discussed key aspects and conducted extensive literature reviews on test datasets in pathology. Here, we summarize the results and derive general recommendations for the collection of test datasets. We address several questions: Which and how many images are needed? How to deal with low-prevalence subsets? How can potential bias be detected? How should datasets be reported? What are the regulatory requirements in different countries? The recommendations are intended to help AI developers demonstrate the utility of their products and to help regulatory agencies and end users verify reported performance measures. Further research is needed to formulate criteria for sufficiently representative test datasets so that AI solutions can operate with less user intervention and better support diagnostic workflows in the future.</p></details> |  |

| **[XDR-LVLM: An Explainable Vision-Language Large Model for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15168v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM (eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports. These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations, showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.</p></details> |  |

Generative models have gained recent attention for the increasingly realistic images they can synthesize, given a sampling of a data type. In this paper, we apply GANs to a sampling distribution of OCTs of the retina. We observe the synthesis of realistic OCT images depicting recognizable pathology such as macular holes, choroidal neovascular membranes, myopic degeneration, cystoid macular edema, and central serous retinopathy amongst others. This represents the first such report of its kind. Potential applications of this new technology include for surgical simulation, for treatment planning, for disease prognostication, and for accelerating the development of new drugs and surgical procedures to treat retinal disease.</p></details> |  |

Such a human-in-the-loop radiology assistant could facilitate a collaborative diagnostic process, thus saving time and improving the quality of reports. Towards this goal, we introduce RaDialog, the first thoroughly evaluated and publicly available large vision-language model for radiology report generation and interactive dialog. RaDialog effectively integrates visual image features and structured pathology findings with a large language model (LLM) while simultaneously adapting it to a specialized domain using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To keep the conversational abilities of the underlying LLM, we propose a comprehensive, semi-automatically labeled, image-grounded instruct dataset for chest X-ray radiology tasks. By training with this dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art clinical correctness in report generation and shows impressive abilities in interactive tasks such as correcting reports and answering questions, serving as a foundational step toward clinical dialog systems.

However, the direct generation of radiology graphs from chest X-ray (CXR) images has not been attempted. To address this gap, we propose a novel approach called Prior-RadGraphFormer that utilizes a transformer model with prior knowledge in the form of a probabilistic knowledge graph (PKG) to generate radiology graphs directly from CXR images. The PKG models the statistical relationship between radiology entities, including anatomical structures and medical observations. This additional contextual information enhances the accuracy of entity and relation extraction. The generated radiology graphs can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as free-text or structured reports generation and multi-label classification of pathologies. Our approach represents a promising method for generating radiology graphs directly from CXR images, and has significant potential for improving medical image analysis and clinical decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>In GR...</summary><p>In GRAIL @ MICCAI 2023</p></details> |

Inside TandemNet, a language model is used to represent report text, which cooperates with the image model in a tandem scheme. We propose a novel dual-attention model that facilitates high-level interactions between visual and semantic information and effectively distills useful features for prediction. In the testing stage, TandemNet can make accurate image prediction with an optional report text input. It also interprets its prediction by producing attention on the image and text informative feature pieces, and further generating diagnostic report paragraphs. Based on a pathological bladder cancer images and their diagnostic reports (BCIDR) dataset, sufficient experiments demonstrate that our method effectively learns and integrates knowledge from multimodalities and obtains significantly improved performance than comparing baselines.</p></details> | MICCAI2017 Oral |

Methods: Glo-UMF decouples quantification tasks by constructing three dedicated deep models: an ultrastructure segmentation model, a glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) region classification model, and an electron-dense deposits (EDD) detection model. Their outputs are integrated through a post-processing workflow with adaptive GFB cropping and measurement location screening, enhancing measurement reliability and providing comprehensive quantitative results that overcome the limitations of traditional grading. Results: Trained on 372 electron microscopy images, Glo-UMF enables simultaneous quantification of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and EDD location. In 115 test cases spanning 9 renal pathological types, the automated quantification results showed strong agreement with pathological reports, with an average processing time of 4.23$\pm$0.48 seconds per case on a CPU environment. Conclusions: The modular design of Glo-UMF allows for flexible extensibility, supporting the joint quantification of multiple features. This framework ensures robust generalization and clinical applicability, demonstrating significant potential as an efficient auxiliary tool in glomerular pathological analysis.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Image-aware Evaluation of Generated Medical Reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17357v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric for automatic medical report generation from X-ray images, VLScore. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing evaluation methods, which either focus solely on textual similarities, ignoring clinical aspects, or concentrate only on a single clinical aspect, the pathology, neglecting all other factors. The key idea of our metric is to measure the similarity between radiology reports while considering the corresponding image. We demonstrate the benefit of our metric through evaluation on a dataset where radiologists marked errors in pairs of reports, showing notable alignment with radiologists' judgments. In addition, we provide a new dataset for evaluating metrics. This dataset includes well-designed perturbations that distinguish between significant modifications (e.g., removal of a diagnosis) and insignificant ones. It highlights the weaknesses in current evaluation metrics and provides a clear framework for analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViKL: A Mammography Interpretation Framework via Multimodal Aggregation of Visual-knowledge-linguistic Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15744v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mammography is the primary imaging tool for breast cancer diagnosis. Despite significant strides in applying deep learning to interpret mammography images, efforts that focus predominantly on visual features often struggle with generalization across datasets. We hypothesize that integrating additional modalities in the radiology practice, notably the linguistic features of reports and manifestation features embodying radiological insights, offers a more powerful, interpretable and generalizable representation. In this paper, we announce MVKL, the first multimodal mammography dataset encompassing multi-view images, detailed manifestations and reports. Based on this dataset, we focus on the challanging task of unsupervised pretraining and propose ViKL, a innovative framework that synergizes Visual, Knowledge, and Linguistic features. This framework relies solely on pairing information without the necessity for pathology labels, which are often challanging to acquire. ViKL employs a triple contrastive learning approach to merge linguistic and knowledge-based insights with visual data, enabling both inter-modality and intra-modality feature enhancement. Our research yields significant findings: 1) Integrating reports and manifestations with unsupervised visual pretraining, ViKL substantially enhances the pathological classification and fosters multimodal interactions. 2) Manifestations can introduce a novel hard negative sample selection mechanism. 3) The multimodal features demonstrate transferability across different datasets. 4) The multimodal pretraining approach curbs miscalibrations and crafts a high-quality representation space. The MVKL dataset and ViKL code are publicly available at https://github.com/wxwxwwxxx/ViKL to support a broad spectrum of future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diverse Image Generation with Diffusion Models and Cross Class Label Learning for Polyp Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05444v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologic diagnosis is a critical phase in deciding the optimal treatment procedure for dealing with colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/Vanshali/PathoPolyp-Diff.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Traceback Learning for Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13267v4)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated medical report generation has demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the workload associated with time-consuming medical reporting. Recent generative representation learning methods have shown promise in integrating vision and language modalities for medical report generation. However, when trained end-to-end and applied directly to medical image-to-text generation, they face two significant challenges: i) difficulty in accurately capturing subtle yet crucial pathological details, and ii) reliance on both visual and textual inputs during inference, leading to performance degradation in zero-shot inference when only images are available. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel multimodal dynamic traceback learning framework (DTrace). Specifically, we introduce a traceback mechanism to supervise the semantic validity of generated content and a dynamic learning strategy to adapt to various proportions of image and text input, enabling text generation without strong reliance on the input from both modalities during inference. The learning of cross-modal knowledge is enhanced by supervising the model to recover masked semantic information from a complementary counterpart. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR, demonstrate that the proposed DTrace framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |

DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment, chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement tuning with clinical reward signals to enhance factual accuracy and fluency. On the MIMIC-CXR benchmark, DiagCoT improved zero-shot disease classification AUC from 0.52 to 0.76 (absolute gain of 0.24), pathology grounding mIoU from 0.08 to 0.31 (absolute gain of 0.23), and report generation BLEU from 0.11 to 0.33 (absolute gain of 0.22). It outperformed state-of-the-art models including LLaVA-Med and CXR-LLAVA on long-tailed diseases and external datasets. By converting unstructured clinical narratives into structured supervision, DiagCoT offers a scalable approach for developing interpretable and diagnostically competent AI systems for radiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anatomy-Guided Weakly-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12704v1)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating a large-scale dataset of abnormality annotation on medical images is a labor-intensive and costly task. Leveraging weak supervision from readily available data such as radiology reports can compensate lack of large-scale data for anomaly detection methods. However, most of the current methods only use image-level pathological observations, failing to utilize the relevant anatomy mentions in reports. Furthermore, Natural Language Processing (NLP)-mined weak labels are noisy due to label sparsity and linguistic ambiguity. We propose an Anatomy-Guided chest X-ray Network (AGXNet) to address these issues of weak annotation. Our framework consists of a cascade of two networks, one responsible for identifying anatomical abnormalities and the second responsible for pathological observations. The critical component in our framework is an anatomy-guided attention module that aids the downstream observation network in focusing on the relevant anatomical regions generated by the anatomy network. We use Positive Unlabeled (PU) learning to account for the fact that lack of mention does not necessarily mean a negative label. Our quantitative and qualitative results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AGXNet in disease and anatomical abnormality localization. Experiments on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset show that the learned feature representations are transferable and can achieve the state-of-the-art performances in disease classification and competitive disease localization results.

| **[Advancing Text-Driven Chest X-Ray Generation with Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06516v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-conditioned image generation diffusion models have begun paving the way for new opportunities in modern medical domain, in particular, generating Chest X-rays (CXRs) from diagnostic reports. Nonetheless, to further drive the diffusion models to generate CXRs that faithfully reflect the complexity and diversity of real data, it has become evident that a nontrivial learning approach is needed. In light of this, we propose CXRL, a framework motivated by the potential of reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we integrate a policy gradient RL approach with well-designed multiple distinctive CXR-domain specific reward models. This approach guides the diffusion denoising trajectory, achieving precise CXR posture and pathological details. Here, considering the complex medical image environment, we present "RL with Comparative Feedback" (RLCF) for the reward mechanism, a human-like comparative evaluation that is known to be more effective and reliable in complex scenarios compared to direct evaluation. Our CXRL framework includes jointly optimizing learnable adaptive condition embeddings (ACE) and the image generator, enabling the model to produce more accurate and higher perceptual CXR quality. Our extensive evaluation of the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our RL-based tuning approach. Consequently, our CXRL generates pathologically realistic CXRs, establishing a new standard for generating CXRs with high fidelity to real-world clinical scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18449v3)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |

Pathology reports on these specimens convey treatment-relevant information. Beyond these reports, the diagnostic process generates extensive and complex information that is difficult to represent in reports, although it is of significant interest to the other medical specialties involved. 3D tissue reconstruction would allow for better spatial visualization, as well as combinations with other imaging modalities. Existing approaches in this area have proven labor-intensive and challenging to integrate into clinical workflows. 3D-SLIVER provides a simplified solution, implemented as an open-source 3DSlicer extension. We outline three specific real-world scenarios to illustrate its potential to improve transparency in diagnostic workflows and contribute to multi-modal research endeavors. Implementing the 3D reconstruction process involved four sub-modules of 3D-SLIVER: digitization of slicing protocol, virtual slicing of arbitrary 3D models based on that protocol, registration of slides with virtual slices using the Coherent Point Drift algorithm, and 3D reconstruction of registered information using convex hulls, Gaussian splatter and linear extrusion. Three use cases to employ 3D-SLIVER are presented: a low-effort approach to pathology workflow integration and two research-related use cases illustrating how to perform retrospective evaluations of PI-RADS predictions and statistically model 3D distributions of morphological patterns. 3D-SLIVER allows for improved interdisciplinary communication among specialties. It is designed for simplicity in application, allowing for flexible integration into various workflows and use cases. Here we focused on the clinical care of prostate cancer patients, but future possibilities are extensive with other neoplasms and in education and research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizable Whole Slide Image Classification with Fine-Grained Visual-Semantic Interaction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19326v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification is often formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in WSI classification. However, existing methods leverage coarse-grained pathogenetic descriptions for visual representation supervision, which are insufficient to capture the complex visual appearance of pathogenetic images, hindering the generalizability of models on diverse downstream tasks. Additionally, processing high-resolution WSIs can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel "Fine-grained Visual-Semantic Interaction" (FiVE) framework for WSI classification. It is designed to enhance the model's generalizability by leveraging the interaction between localized visual patterns and fine-grained pathological semantics. Specifically, with meticulously designed queries, we start by utilizing a large language model to extract fine-grained pathological descriptions from various non-standardized raw reports. The output descriptions are then reconstructed into fine-grained labels used for training. By introducing a Task-specific Fine-grained Semantics (TFS) module, we enable prompts to capture crucial visual information in WSIs, which enhances representation learning and augments generalization capabilities significantly. Furthermore, given that pathological visual patterns are redundantly distributed across tissue slices, we sample a subset of visual instances during training. Our method demonstrates robust generalizability and strong transferability, dominantly outperforming the counterparts on the TCGA Lung Cancer dataset with at least 9.19% higher accuracy in few-shot experiments.

The compression approach was tested on more common computer vision datasets such as CIFAR10, and we explore which image characteristics enable this compression ratio on cancer imaging data but not generic images. We generate and visualize embeddings from the compressed latent space and demonstrate how they are useful for clinical interpretation of data, and how in the future such latent embeddings can be used to accelerate search of clinical imaging data.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose MDNet to establish a direct multimodal mapping between medical images and diagnostic reports that can read images, generate diagnostic reports, retrieve images by symptom descriptions, and visualize attention, to provide justifications of the network diagnosis process. MDNet includes an image model and a language model. The image model is proposed to enhance multi-scale feature ensembles and utilization efficiency. The language model, integrated with our improved attention mechanism, aims to read and explore discriminative image feature descriptions from reports to learn a direct mapping from sentence words to image pixels. The overall network is trained end-to-end by using our developed optimization strategy. Based on a pathology bladder cancer images and its diagnostic reports (BCIDR) dataset, we conduct sufficient experiments to demonstrate that MDNet outperforms comparative baselines. The proposed image model obtains state-of-the-art performance on two CIFAR datasets as well.</p></details> | CVPR2017 Oral |

We developed fine-tuned language models (LMs) to classify brain MRI reports as normal (reports with limited pathology) or abnormal, fine-tuning BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and RadBERT on 44,661 reports. We also explored the reasoning capabilities of a leading LM, Gemini 1.5-Pro, for normal report categorization. Automated image processing and modeling generated brain growth charts from LM-classified normal scans, comparing them to human-derived charts. Fine-tuned LMs achieved high classification performance (F1-Score >97%), with unbalanced training mitigating class imbalance. Performance was robust on out-of-distribution data, with full text outperforming summary (impression) sections. Gemini 1.5-Pro showed a promising categorization performance, especially with clinical inference. LM-derived brain growth charts were nearly identical to human-annotated charts (r = 0.99, p < 2.2e-16). Our LMs offer scalable analysis of radiology reports, enabling automated classification of brain MRIs in large datasets. One application is automated generation of brain growth charts for benchmarking quantitative image features. Further research is needed to address data heterogeneity and optimize LM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

While there have been efforts to tackle these issues, they are either limited in their interactivity by not supporting textual queries or fail to also offer localized interpretability. Therefore, we propose a novel multitask architecture and training paradigm integrating textual prompts and bounding boxes for diverse aspects like anatomical regions and pathologies. We call this approach the Chest X-Ray Explainer (ChEX). Evaluations across a heterogeneous set of 9 chest X-ray tasks, including localized image interpretation and report generation, showcase its competitiveness with SOTA models while additional analysis demonstrates ChEX's interactive capabilities.

A recent line of work has focused on automatically generating reports with NLP methods. However, different audiences have different purposes when writing/reading medical reports -- for example, healthcare professionals care more about pathology, whereas patients are more concerned with the diagnosis ("Is there any abnormality?"). The expectation gap results in a common situation where patients find their medical reports to be ambiguous and therefore unsure about the next steps. In this work, we explore the audience expectation gap in healthcare and summarize common ambiguities that lead patients to be confused about their diagnosis into three categories: medical jargon, contradictory findings, and misleading grammatical errors. Based on our analysis, we define a disambiguation rewriting task to regenerate an input to be unambiguous while preserving information about the original content. We further propose a rewriting algorithm based on contrastive pretraining and perturbation-based rewriting. In addition, we create two datasets, OpenI-Annotated based on chest reports and VA-Annotated based on general medical reports, with available binary labels for ambiguity and abnormality presence annotated by radiology specialists. Experimental results on these datasets show that our proposed algorithm effectively rewrites input sentences in a less ambiguous way with high content fidelity. Our code and annotated data are released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2023. 13 pages including 4-page supplementary materials</p></details> |

Previous Transformer-based models struggled to integrate visual and textual information under limited supervision. In response, we propose a novel vision-language model for retinal image captioning that combines visual and textual features through a guided context self-attention mechanism. This approach captures both intricate details and the global clinical context, even in data-scarce scenarios. Extensive experiments on the DeepEyeNet dataset demonstrate a 0.023 BLEU@4 improvement, along with significant qualitative advancements, highlighting the effectiveness of our model in generating comprehensive medical captions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

The key features of the BIRL framework are: easily extendable, performance evaluation, parallel experimentation, simple visualisations, experiment's time-out limit, resuming unfinished experiments. From the research practice, we identified and focused on these two main use-cases: (a) comparison of user's (newly developed) method with some State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods on a common dataset and (b) experimenting SOTA methods on user's custom dataset (which should contain landmark annotation). Moreover, we present an integration of several standard image registration methods aiming at biomedical imaging into the BIRL framework. This report also contains experimental results of these SOTA methods on the CIMA dataset, which is a dataset of Whole Slice Imaging (WSI) from histology/pathology containing several multi-stain tissue samples from three tissue kinds.

| **[Are the Majority of Public Computational Notebooks Pathologically Non-Executable?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04184v4)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks are the de facto platforms for exploratory data science, offering an interactive programming environment where users can create, modify, and execute code cells in any sequence. However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |

Extracting pathologic findings and diagnoses from radiology reports is important for quality control, population health, and monitoring of disease progress. Existing works, primarily rely either on rule-based systems or transformer-based pre-trained model fine-tuning, but could not take the factual and uncertain information into consideration, and therefore generate false-positive outputs. In this work, we introduce three sedulous augmentation techniques which retain factual and critical information while generating augmentations for contrastive learning. We introduce RadBERT-CL, which fuses these information into BlueBert via a self-supervised contrastive loss. Our experiments on MIMIC-CXR show superior performance of RadBERT-CL on fine-tuning for multi-class, multi-label report classification. We illustrate that when few labeled data are available, RadBERT-CL outperforms conventional SOTA transformers (BERT/BlueBert) by significantly larger margins (6-11%). We also show that the representations learned by RadBERT-CL can capture critical medical information in the latent space.</p></details> |  |

GPT-4V represents a breakthrough in artificial general intelligence (AGI) for computer vision, with applications in the biomedical domain. We assess GPT-4V's performance across 16 medical imaging categories, including radiology, oncology, ophthalmology, pathology, and more. Tasks include modality recognition, anatomy localization, disease diagnosis, report generation, and lesion detection. The extensive experiments provide insights into GPT-4V's strengths and weaknesses. Results show GPT-4V's proficiency in modality and anatomy recognition but difficulty with disease diagnosis and localization. GPT-4V excels at diagnostic report generation, indicating strong image captioning skills. While promising for biomedical imaging AI, GPT-4V requires further enhancement and validation before clinical deployment. We emphasize responsible development and testing for trustworthy integration of biomedical AGI. This rigorous evaluation of GPT-4V on diverse medical images advances understanding of multimodal large language models (LLMs) and guides future work toward impactful healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |

Medicine's inherently multimodal nature incorporating scans and text-based medical histories to write reports makes it conducive to benefit from these leaps in AI capabilities. We evaluate the publicly available, state of the art, foundational vision-language models for chest X-ray interpretation across several datasets and benchmarks. We use linear probes to evaluate the performance of various components including CheXagent's vision transformer and Q-former, which outperform the industry-standard Torch X-ray Vision models across many different datasets showing robust generalisation capabilities. Importantly, we find that vision-language models often hallucinate with confident language, which slows down clinical interpretation. Based on these findings, we develop an agent-based vision-language approach for report generation using CheXagent's linear probes and BioViL-T's phrase grounding tools to generate uncertainty-aware radiology reports with pathologies localised and described based on their likelihood. We thoroughly evaluate our vision-language agents using NLP metrics, chest X-ray benchmarks and clinical evaluations by developing an evaluation platform to perform a user study with respiratory specialists. Our results show considerable improvements in accuracy, interpretability and safety of the AI-generated reports. We stress the importance of analysing results for normal and abnormal scans separately. Finally, we emphasise the need for larger paired (scan and report) datasets alongside data augmentation to tackle overfitting seen in these large vision-language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Super...</summary><p>Supervised by Professor Ben Glocker</p></details> |
| **[Automating Intervention Discovery from Scientific Literature: A Progressive Ontology Prompting and Dual-LLM Framework](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00054v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying effective interventions from the scientific literature is challenging due to the high volume of publications, specialized terminology, and inconsistent reporting formats, making manual curation laborious and prone to oversight. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs), which integrates a progressive ontology prompting (POP) algorithm with a dual-agent system, named LLM-Duo. On the one hand, the POP algorithm conducts a prioritized breadth-first search (BFS) across a predefined ontology, generating structured prompt templates and action sequences to guide the automatic annotation process. On the other hand, the LLM-Duo system features two specialized LLM agents, an explorer and an evaluator, working collaboratively and adversarially to continuously refine annotation quality. We showcase the real-world applicability of our framework through a case study focused on speech-language intervention discovery. Experimental results show that our approach surpasses advanced baselines, achieving more accurate and comprehensive annotations through a fully automated process. Our approach successfully identified 2,421 interventions from a corpus of 64,177 research articles in the speech-language pathology domain, culminating in the creation of a publicly accessible intervention knowledge base with great potential to benefit the speech-language pathology community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |

These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smart Chest X-ray Worklist Prioritization using Artificial Intelligence: A Clinical Workflow Simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08625v2)** | 2020-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim is to evaluate whether smart worklist prioritization by artificial intelligence (AI) can optimize the radiology workflow and reduce report turnaround times (RTAT) for critical findings in chest radiographs (CXRs). Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative predictions by AI -- resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist. We developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a university hospital by incorporating hospital specific CXR generation rates, reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the standard worklist processing "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) and compared it with a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate, congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass and foreign object. Furthermore, we introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest urgency is assigned to the examination. The average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all Prioritization-simulations compared to the FIFO-simulation (e.g. pneumothorax: 35.6 min vs. 80.1 min; p $<0.0001$), while the maximum RTAT for most findings increased at the same time (e.g. pneumothorax: 1293 min vs 890 min; p $<0.0001$). Our "upper limit" substantially reduced the maximum RTAT all classes (e.g. pneumothorax: 979 min vs. 1293 min / 1178 min; p $<0.0001$). Our simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small maximum RTAT as FIFO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Deep Generative Models for Anomaly Detection in Neuroimaging: A Systematic Scoping Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14462v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging. Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49 studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual) reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce, as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning, supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within- and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling, development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and rigorous clinical validation.</p></details> |  |

We analyse their potential under conditions in which training data is scarce and comes from a non-natural domain. Specifically, we investigate whether pruned models that are found on the popular CIFAR-10/100 and Fashion-MNIST datasets, generalize to seven different datasets that come from the fields of digital pathology and digital heritage. Our results show that there are significant benefits in transferring and training sparse architectures over larger parametrized models, since in all of our experiments pruned networks, winners of the lottery ticket hypothesis, significantly outperform their larger unpruned counterparts. These results suggest that winning initializations do contain inductive biases that are generic to some extent, although, as reported by our experiments on the biomedical datasets, their generalization properties can be more limiting than what has been so far observed in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete Diffusion Models with MLLMs for Unified Medical Multimodal Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06131v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.</p></details> | 16 pages,6 figures |

We aimed to investigate the performance of an institutionally developed system for prostate cancer detection, grading, and workflow optimization and to contrast this with commercial alternatives. From August 2021 to March 2023, we scanned 21,396 slides from 1,147 patients receiving prostate biopsy. We developed models for cancer detection, grading, and screening of equivocal cases for IHC ordering. We compared the performance of task-specific prostate models with general-purpose foundation models in a prospectively collected dataset that reflects our patient population. We also evaluated the contributions of a bespoke model designed to improve sensitivity to small cancer foci and perception of low-resolution patterns. We found high concordance with pathologist ground-truth in detection (area under curve 98.5%, sensitivity 95.0%, and specificity 97.8%), ISUP grading (Cohen's kappa 0.869), grade group 3 or higher classification (area under curve 97.5%, sensitivity 94.9%, specificity 96.6%). Screening models could correctly classify 55% of biopsy blocks where immunohistochemistry was ordered with a 1.4% error rate. No statistically significant differences were observed between task-specific and foundation models in cancer detection, although the task-specific model is significantly smaller and faster. Institutions like academic medical centers that have high scanning volumes and report abstraction capabilities can develop highly accurate computational pathology models for internal use. These models have the potential to aid in quality control role and to improve resource allocation and workflow in the pathology lab to help meet future challenges in prostate cancer diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we split the gigapixel image into a sequence of millions of patches and project them linearly into embeddings. LongNet is then employed to model the extremely long sequence, generating representations that capture both short-range and long-range dependencies. The linear computation complexity of LongNet, along with its distributed algorithm, enables us to overcome the constraints of both computation and memory. We apply LongViT in the field of computational pathology, aiming for cancer diagnosis and prognosis within gigapixel whole-slide images. Experimental results demonstrate that LongViT effectively encodes gigapixel images and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on cancer subtyping and survival prediction.

Existing methods struggle with fine-grained feature extraction, multimodal alignment, and generalization across diverse imaging types, often relying on vanilla transformers and focusing primarily on chest X-rays. We propose MicarVLMoE, a vision-language mixture-of-experts model with gated cross-aligned fusion, designed to address these limitations. Our architecture includes: (i) a multiscale vision encoder (MSVE) for capturing anatomical details at varying resolutions, (ii) a multihead dual-branch latent attention (MDLA) module for vision-language alignment through latent bottleneck representations, and (iii) a modulated mixture-of-experts (MoE) decoder for adaptive expert specialization. We extend MIR to CT scans, retinal imaging, MRI scans, and gross pathology images, reporting state-of-the-art results on COVCTR, MMR, PGROSS, and ROCO datasets. Extensive experiments and ablations confirm improved clinical accuracy, cross-modal alignment, and model interpretability.

By manually tagging a relatively small set of sentences, we were able to construct a training set of 959k studies. A deep learning model was trained to predict the findings given the patient frontal and lateral scans. For 12 of the findings we compare the model performance against a team of radiologists and show that in most cases the radiologists agree on average more with the algorithm than with each other.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2018</p></details> |

The application of artificial intelligence tools to these multifaceted sensing technologies has the potential to revolutionize the prognosis, diagnosis, and management of human health and disease. However, current approaches to biomedical AI typically only train and evaluate with one or a small set of medical modalities and tasks. This limitation hampers the development of comprehensive tools that can leverage the rich interconnected information across many heterogeneous biomedical sensors. To address this challenge, we present MultiMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate and enable large-scale learning across a wide spectrum of medical modalities and tasks. MultiMed consists of 2.56 million samples across ten medical modalities such as medical reports, pathology, genomics, and protein data, and is structured into eleven challenging tasks, including disease prognosis, protein structure prediction, and medical question answering. Using MultiMed, we conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art unimodal, multimodal, and multitask models. Our analysis highlights the advantages of training large-scale medical models across many related modalities and tasks. Moreover, MultiMed enables studies of generalization across related medical concepts, robustness to real-world noisy data and distribution shifts, and novel modality combinations to improve prediction performance. MultiMed will be publicly available and regularly updated and welcomes inputs from the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReFINE: A Reward-Based Framework for Interpretable and Nuanced Evaluation of Radiology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17301v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated radiology report generation (R2Gen) has advanced significantly, introducing challenges in accurate evaluation due to its complexity. Traditional metrics often fall short by relying on rigid word-matching or focusing only on pathological entities, leading to inconsistencies with human assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce ReFINE, an automatic evaluation metric designed specifically for R2Gen. Our metric utilizes a reward model, guided by our margin-based reward enforcement loss, along with a tailored training data design that enables customization of evaluation criteria to suit user-defined needs. It not only scores reports according to user-specified criteria but also provides detailed sub-scores, enhancing interpretability and allowing users to adjust the criteria between different aspects of reports. Leveraging GPT-4, we designed an easy-to-use data generation pipeline, enabling us to produce extensive training data based on two distinct scoring systems, each containing reports of varying quality along with corresponding scores. These GPT-generated reports are then paired as accepted and rejected samples through our pairing rule to train an LLM towards our fine-grained reward model, which assigns higher rewards to the report with high quality. Our reward-control loss enables this model to simultaneously output multiple individual rewards corresponding to the number of evaluation criteria, with their summation as our final ReFINE. Our experiments demonstrate ReFINE's heightened correlation with human judgments and superior performance in model selection compared to traditional metrics. Notably, our model provides both an overall score and individual scores for each evaluation item, enhancing interpretability. We also demonstrate its flexible training across various evaluation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency Learning for Vision-Grounded Medical Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25963v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However, existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii) achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPathAgent: An Agent-based Foundation Model for Interpretable High-Resolution Pathology Image Analysis Mimicking Pathologists' Diagnostic Logic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20510v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.</p></details> | 52 pages, 34 figures |
| **[FODA-PG for Enhanced Medical Imaging Narrative Generation: Adaptive Differentiation of Normal and Abnormal Attributes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03947v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Medical Imaging Narrative generation aims to alleviate the workload of radiologists by producing accurate clinical descriptions directly from radiological images. However, the subtle visual nuances and domain-specific terminology in medical images pose significant challenges compared to generic image captioning tasks. Existing approaches often neglect the vital distinction between normal and abnormal findings, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose FODA-PG, a novel Fine-grained Organ-Disease Adaptive Partitioning Graph framework that addresses these limitations through domain-adaptive learning. FODA-PG constructs a granular graphical representation of radiological findings by separating disease-related attributes into distinct "disease-specific" and "disease-free" categories based on their clinical significance and location. This adaptive partitioning enables our model to capture the nuanced differences between normal and pathological states, mitigating the impact of data biases. By integrating this fine-grained semantic knowledge into a powerful transformer-based architecture and providing rigorous mathematical justifications for its effectiveness, FODA-PG generates precise and clinically coherent reports with enhanced generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on the IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation in medical report generation.</p></details> |  |

Efficient strategies for the extraction of information about ADRs from free text resources are essential to support the work of experts, employed in the crucial task of detecting and classifying unexpected pathologies possibly related to drug assumptions. Narrative ADR descriptions may be collected in several way, e.g. by monitoring social networks or through the so called spontaneous reporting, the main method pharmacovigilance adopts in order to identify ADRs. The encoding of free-text ADR descriptions according to MedDRA standard terminology is central for report analysis. It is a complex work, which has to be manually implemented by the pharmacovigilance experts. The manual encoding is expensive (in terms of time). Moreover, a problem about the accuracy of the encoding may occur, since the number of reports is growing up day by day. In this paper, we propose MagiCoder, an efficient Natural Language Processing algorithm able to automatically derive MedDRA terminologies from free-text ADR descriptions. MagiCoder is part of VigiWork, a web application for online ADR reporting and analysis. From a practical view-point, MagiCoder radically reduces the revision time of ADR reports: the pharmacologist has simply to revise and validate the automatic solution versus the hard task of choosing solutions in the 70k terms of MedDRA. This improvement of the expert work efficiency has a meaningful impact on the quality of data analysis. Moreover, our procedure is general purpose. We developed MagiCoder for the Italian pharmacovigilance language, but preliminarily analyses show that it is robust to language and dictionary changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted, 22 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Our evaluation encompasses 17 human body systems, including Central Nervous System, Head and Neck, Cardiac, Chest, Hematology, Hepatobiliary, Gastrointestinal, Urogenital, Gynecology, Obstetrics, Breast, Musculoskeletal, Spine, Vascular, Oncology, Trauma, Pediatrics, with images taken from 8 modalities used in daily clinic routine, e.g., X-ray, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), Mammography, Ultrasound, and Pathology. We probe the GPT-4V's ability on multiple clinical tasks with or without patent history provided, including imaging modality and anatomy recognition, disease diagnosis, report generation, disease localisation. Our observation shows that, while GPT-4V demonstrates proficiency in distinguishing between medical image modalities and anatomy, it faces significant challenges in disease diagnosis and generating comprehensive reports. These findings underscore that while large multimodal models have made significant advancements in computer vision and natural language processing, it remains far from being used to effectively support real-world medical applications and clinical decision-making.

| **[A Sensitivity Analysis of Pathfinder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.1106v1)** | 2013-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge elicitation is one of the major bottlenecks in expert system design. Systems based on Bayes nets require two types of information--network structure and parameters (or probabilities). Both must be elicited from the domain expert. In general, parameters have greater opacity than structure, and more time is spent in their refinement than in any other phase of elicitation. Thus, it is important to determine the point of diminishing returns, beyond which further refinements will promise little (if any) improvement. Sensitivity analyses address precisely this issue--the sensitivity of a model to the precision of its parameters. In this paper, we report the results of a sensitivity analysis of Pathfinder, a Bayes net based system for diagnosing pathologies of the lymph system. This analysis is intended to shed some light on the relative importance of structure and parameters to system performance, as well as the sensitivity of a system based on a Bayes net to noise in its assessed parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in Proceedings of the Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1990)</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Medical Phrase Grounding with Off-the-shelf Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12920v4)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing the exact pathological regions in a given medical scan is an important imaging problem that traditionally requires a large amount of bounding box ground truth annotations to be accurately solved. However, there exist alternative, potentially weaker, forms of supervision, such as accompanying free-text reports, which are readily available. The task of performing localization with textual guidance is commonly referred to as phrase grounding. In this work, we use a publicly available Foundation Model, namely the Latent Diffusion Model, to perform this challenging task. This choice is supported by the fact that the Latent Diffusion Model, despite being generative in nature, contains cross-attention mechanisms that implicitly align visual and textual features, thus leading to intermediate representations that are suitable for the task at hand. In addition, we aim to perform this task in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without any training on the target task, meaning that the model's weights remain frozen. To this end, we devise strategies to select features and also refine them via post-processing without extra learnable parameters. We compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art approaches which explicitly enforce image-text alignment in a joint embedding space via contrastive learning. Results on a popular chest X-ray benchmark indicate that our method is competitive with SOTA on different types of pathology, and even outperforms them on average in terms of two metrics (mean IoU and AUC-ROC). Source code will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/vios-s.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, IEEE J-BHI Special Issue on Foundation Models in Medical Imaging</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Chronic Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Vision-Language Models: A Multi modal Framework for Precision Analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14536v2)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: This study proposes a Vision-Language Model (VLM) leveraging the SIGLIP encoder and Gemma-3b transformer decoder to enhance automated chronic tuberculosis (TB) screening. By integrating chest X-ray images with clinical data, the model addresses the challenges of manual interpretation, improving diagnostic consistency and accessibility, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Methods: The VLM architecture combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) for visual encoding and a transformer-based text encoder to process clinical context, such as patient histories and treatment records. Cross-modal attention mechanisms align radiographic features with textual information, while the Gemma-3b decoder generates comprehensive diagnostic reports. The model was pre-trained on 5 million paired medical images and texts and fine-tuned using 100,000 chronic TB-specific chest X-rays. Results: The model demonstrated high precision (94 percent) and recall (94 percent) for detecting key chronic TB pathologies, including fibrosis, calcified granulomas, and bronchiectasis. Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores exceeded 0.93, and Intersection over Union (IoU) values were above 0.91, validating its effectiveness in detecting and localizing TB-related abnormalities. Conclusion: The VLM offers a robust and scalable solution for automated chronic TB diagnosis, integrating radiographic and clinical data to deliver actionable and context-aware insights. Future work will address subtle pathologies and dataset biases to enhance the model's generalizability, ensuring equitable performance across diverse populations and healthcare settings.</p></details> | 10 pages , 3 figures |
| **[A self-supervised text-vision framework for automated brain abnormality detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02782v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial neural networks trained on large, expert-labelled datasets are considered state-of-the-art for a range of medical image recognition tasks. However, categorically labelled datasets are time-consuming to generate and constrain classification to a pre-defined, fixed set of classes. For neuroradiological applications in particular, this represents a barrier to clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we present a self-supervised text-vision framework that learns to detect clinically relevant abnormalities in brain MRI scans by directly leveraging the rich information contained in accompanying free-text neuroradiology reports. Our training approach consisted of two-steps. First, a dedicated neuroradiological language model - NeuroBERT - was trained to generate fixed-dimensional vector representations of neuroradiology reports (N = 50,523) via domain-specific self-supervised learning tasks. Next, convolutional neural networks (one per MRI sequence) learnt to map individual brain scans to their corresponding text vector representations by optimising a mean square error loss. Once trained, our text-vision framework can be used to detect abnormalities in unreported brain MRI examinations by scoring scans against suitable query sentences (e.g., 'there is an acute stroke', 'there is hydrocephalus' etc.), enabling a range of classification-based applications including automated triage. Potentially, our framework could also serve as a clinical decision support tool, not only by suggesting findings to radiologists and detecting errors in provisional reports, but also by retrieving and displaying examples of pathologies from historical examinations that could be relevant to the current case based on textual descriptors.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment for Generalized Medical Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06044v1)** | 2022-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning medical visual representations directly from paired radiology reports has become an emerging topic in representation learning. However, existing medical image-text joint learning methods are limited by instance or local supervision analysis, ignoring disease-level semantic correspondences. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Granularity Cross-modal Alignment (MGCA) framework for generalized medical visual representation learning by harnessing the naturally exhibited semantic correspondences between medical image and radiology reports at three different levels, i.e., pathological region-level, instance-level, and disease-level. Specifically, we first incorporate the instance-wise alignment module by maximizing the agreement between image-report pairs. Further, for token-wise alignment, we introduce a bidirectional cross-attention strategy to explicitly learn the matching between fine-grained visual tokens and text tokens, followed by contrastive learning to align them. More important, to leverage the high-level inter-subject relationship semantic (e.g., disease) correspondences, we design a novel cross-modal disease-level alignment paradigm to enforce the cross-modal cluster assignment consistency. Extensive experimental results on seven downstream medical image datasets covering image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the stable and superior performance of our framework.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2022 |
| **[Event-based clinical findings extraction from radiology reports with pre-trained language model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.13512v1)** | 2021-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology reports contain a diverse and rich set of clinical abnormalities documented by radiologists during their interpretation of the images. Comprehensive semantic representations of radiological findings would enable a wide range of secondary use applications to support diagnosis, triage, outcomes prediction, and clinical research. In this paper, we present a new corpus of radiology reports annotated with clinical findings. Our annotation schema captures detailed representations of pathologic findings that are observable on imaging ("lesions") and other types of clinical problems ("medical problems"). The schema used an event-based representation to capture fine-grained details, including assertion, anatomy, characteristics, size, count, etc. Our gold standard corpus contained a total of 500 annotated computed tomography (CT) reports. We extracted triggers and argument entities using two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including BERT. We then predicted the linkages between trigger and argument entities (referred to as argument roles) using a BERT-based relation extraction model. We achieved the best extraction performance using a BERT model pre-trained on 3 million radiology reports from our institution: 90.9%-93.4% F1 for finding triggers 72.0%-85.6% F1 for arguments roles. To assess model generalizability, we used an external validation set randomly sampled from the MIMIC Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) database. The extraction performance on this validation set was 95.6% for finding triggers and 79.1%-89.7% for argument roles, demonstrating that the model generalized well to the cross-institutional data with a different imaging modality. We extracted the finding events from all the radiology reports in the MIMIC-CXR database and provided the extractions to the research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pretrained Vision Models for Predicting High-Risk Breast Cancer Stage](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10730v1)** | 2023-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer is increasingly a global health issue. Seconding cardiovascular diseases, cancers are the second biggest cause of death in the world with millions of people succumbing to the disease every year. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, by the end of 2020, more than 7.8 million women have been diagnosed with breast cancer, making it the world's most prevalent cancer. In this paper, using the Nightingale Open Science dataset of digital pathology (breast biopsy) images, we leverage the capabilities of pre-trained computer vision models for the breast cancer stage prediction task. While individual models achieve decent performances, we find out that the predictions of an ensemble model are more efficient, and offer a winning solution\footnote{https://www.nightingalescience.org/updates/hbc1-results}. We also provide analyses of the results and explore pathways for better interpretability and generalization.

| **[Med-GLIP: Advancing Medical Language-Image Pre-training with Large-scale Grounded Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10528v2)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image grounding aims to align natural language phrases with specific regions in medical images, serving as a foundational task for intelligent diagnosis, visual question answering (VQA), and automated report generation (MRG). However, existing research is constrained by limited modality coverage, coarse-grained annotations, and the absence of a unified, generalizable grounding framework. To address these challenges, we construct a large-scale medical grounding dataset Med-GLIP-5M comprising over 5.3 million region-level annotations across seven imaging modalities, covering diverse anatomical structures and pathological findings. The dataset supports both segmentation and grounding tasks with hierarchical region labels, ranging from organ-level boundaries to fine-grained lesions. Based on this foundation, we propose Med-GLIP, a modality-aware grounding framework trained on Med-GLIP-5M. Rather than relying on explicitly designed expert modules, Med-GLIP implicitly acquires hierarchical semantic understanding from diverse training data -- enabling it to recognize multi-granularity structures, such as distinguishing lungs from pneumonia lesions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Med-GLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple grounding benchmarks. Furthermore, integrating its spatial outputs into downstream tasks, including medical VQA and report generation, leads to substantial performance gains. Our dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doctor Sun: A Bilingual Multimodal Large Language Model for Biomedical AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08270v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance. However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical multimodal research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating U-net Brain Extraction for Multi-site and Longitudinal Preclinical Stroke Imaging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.05716v1)** | 2022-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rodent stroke models are important for evaluating treatments and understanding the pathophysiology and behavioral changes of brain ischemia, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable tool for measuring outcome in preclinical studies. Brain extraction is an essential first step in most neuroimaging pipelines; however, it can be challenging in the presence of severe pathology and when dataset quality is highly variable. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can improve accuracy and reduce operator time, facilitating high throughput preclinical studies. As part of an ongoing preclinical stroke imaging study, we developed a deep-learning mouse brain extraction tool by using a U-net CNN. While previous studies have evaluated U-net architectures, we sought to evaluate their practical performance across data types. We ask how performance is affected with data across: six imaging centers, two time points after experimental stroke, and across four MRI contrasts. We trained, validated, and tested a typical U-net model on 240 multimodal MRI datasets including quantitative multi-echo T2 and apparent diffusivity coefficient (ADC) maps, and performed qualitative evaluation with a large preclinical stroke database (N=1,368). We describe the design and development of this system, and report our findings linking data characteristics to segmentation performance. We consistently found high accuracy and ability of the U-net architecture to generalize performance in a range of 95-97% accuracy, with only modest reductions in performance based on lower fidelity imaging hardware and brain pathology. This work can help inform the design of future preclinical rodent imaging studies and improve their scalability and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathGene: Benchmarking Driver Gene Mutations and Exon Prediction Using Multicenter Lung Cancer Histopathology Image Dataset](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00096v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

| **[Using Contextual Information to Improve Blood Glucose Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01735v1)** | 2019-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blood glucose value prediction is an important task in diabetes management. While it is reported that glucose concentration is sensitive to social context such as mood, physical activity, stress, diet, alongside the influence of diabetes pathologies, we need more research on data and methodologies to incorporate and evaluate signals about such temporal context into prediction models. Person-generated data sources, such as actively contributed surveys as well as passively mined data from social media offer opportunity to capture such context, however the self-reported nature and sparsity of such data mean that such data are noisier and less specific than physiological measures such as blood glucose values themselves. Therefore, here we propose a Gaussian Process model to both address these data challenges and combine blood glucose and latent feature representations of contextual data for a novel multi-signal blood glucose prediction task. We find this approach outperforms common methods for multi-variate data, as well as using the blood glucose values in isolation. Given a robust evaluation across two blood glucose datasets with different forms of contextual information, we conclude that multi-signal Gaussian Processes can improve blood glucose prediction by using contextual information and may provide a significant shift in blood glucose prediction research and practice.</p></details> | 17 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Leveraging large language models for structured information extraction from pathology reports](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12183v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Structured information extraction from unstructured histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research. Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to manual extraction by a trained human annotator. Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family, which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111 histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study, extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary. Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama 3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106, respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p <0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for self-hosting. Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language. Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate analytics through improved accessibility and interoperability.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |

Moreover, these LLMs typically have several billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems. Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on nearly 2.7M clinical notes and over 515K pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on two cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that the CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results with F1 score of 91.78% on phenotyping extraction and 86.81% on disganois generation. It outperformed existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 9.23%. Additionally, the CancerLLM demonstrated its efficiency on time and GPU usage, and robustness comparing with other LLMs. We demonstrated that CancerLLM can potentially provide an effective and robust solution to advance clinical research and practice in cancer domain</p></details> | <details><summary>new v...</summary><p>new version, add the RAG version of cancerLLM</p></details> |

Recent approaches generally rely on weakly supervised learning due to the ease of acquiring case-level labels from pathology reports. However, patch-level classification is preferable in applications where only a limited number of cases are available or when local prediction accuracy is critical. On the other hand, acquiring extensive datasets with localized labels for training is not feasible. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised patch-level histopathological image classification model, named CLASS-M, that does not require extensively labeled datasets. CLASS-M is formed by two main parts: a contrastive learning module that uses separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images generated through an adaptive stain separation process, and a module with pseudo-labels using MixUp. We compare our model with other state-of-the-art models on two clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets. We demonstrate that our CLASS-M model has the best performance on both datasets.

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniMRI: A Unified Vision--Language Foundation Model for Generalist MRI Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17524v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting. While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining, vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction, anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.</p></details> |  |

Being undertaken at primary healthcare centers, they require the presence of an on-premise reporting Radiologist, which is a challenge in low and middle income countries. This has inspired the development of machine learning based automation of the screening process. While recent efforts demonstrate a performance benchmark using an ensemble of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), our systematic search over multiple standard CNN architectures identified single candidate CNN models whose classification performances were found to be at par with ensembles. Over 63 experiments spanning 400 hours, executed on a 11:3 FP32 TensorTFLOPS compute system, we found the Xception and ResNet-18 architectures to be consistent performers in identifying co-existing disease conditions with an average AUC of 0.87 across nine pathologies. We conclude on the reliability of the models by assessing their saliency maps generated using the randomized input sampling for explanation (RISE) method and qualitatively validating them against manual annotations locally sourced from an experienced Radiologist. We also draw a critical note on the limitations of the publicly available CheXpert dataset primarily on account of disparity in class distribution in training vs. testing sets, and unavailability of sufficient samples for few classes, which hampers quantitative reporting due to sample insufficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in EMBC 2020, 4 pages+2 page Appendix</p></details> |

However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks do not systematically evaluate whether these models truly reason like human clinicians or merely imitate superficial patterns. To address this gap, we propose DrVD-Bench, the first multimodal benchmark for clinical visual reasoning. DrVD-Bench consists of three modules: Visual Evidence Comprehension, Reasoning Trajectory Assessment, and Report Generation Evaluation, comprising a total of 7,789 image-question pairs. Our benchmark covers 20 task types, 17 diagnostic categories, and five imaging modalities-CT, MRI, ultrasound, radiography, and pathology. DrVD-Bench is explicitly structured to reflect the clinical reasoning workflow from modality recognition to lesion identification and diagnosis. We benchmark 19 VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific, open-source and proprietary models, and observe that performance drops sharply as reasoning complexity increases. While some models begin to exhibit traces of human-like reasoning, they often still rely on shortcut correlations rather than grounded visual understanding. DrVD-Bench offers a rigorous and structured evaluation framework to guide the development of clinically trustworthy VLMs.</p></details> |  |

While inference with these systems on consumer-grade GPUs is increasingly feasible, training from scratch requires large captioned datasets and significant computational resources. In medical image generation, the limited availability of large, publicly accessible datasets with text reports poses challenges due to legal and ethical concerns. This work shows that adapting pre-trained Stable Diffusion models to medical imaging modalities is achievable by training text embeddings using Textual Inversion. In this study, we experimented with small medical datasets (100 samples each from three modalities) and trained within hours to generate diagnostically accurate images, as judged by an expert radiologist. Experiments with Textual Inversion training and inference parameters reveal the necessity of larger embeddings and more examples in the medical domain. Classification experiments show an increase in diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, from 0.78 to 0.80. Further experiments demonstrate embedding flexibility through disease interpolation, combining pathologies, and inpainting for precise disease appearance control. The trained embeddings are compact (less than 1 MB), enabling easy data sharing with reduced privacy concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MIDL 2024</p></details> |
| **[PubSqueezer: A Text-Mining Web Tool to Transform Unstructured Documents into Structured Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03123v2)** | 2020-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The amount of scientific papers published every day is daunting and constantly increasing. Keeping up with literature represents a challenge. If one wants to start exploring new topics it is hard to have a big picture without reading lots of articles. Furthermore, as one reads through literature, making mental connections is crucial to ask new questions which might lead to discoveries. In this work, I present a web tool which uses a Text Mining strategy to transform large collections of unstructured biomedical articles into structured data. Generated results give a quick overview on complex topics which can possibly suggest not explicitly reported information. In particular, I show two Data Science analyses. First, I present a literature based rare diseases network build using this tool in the hope that it will help clarify some aspects of these less popular pathologies. Secondly, I show how a literature based analysis conducted with PubSqueezer results allows to describe known facts about SARS-CoV-2. In one sentence, data generated with PubSqueezer make it easy to use scientific literate in any computational analysis such as machine learning, natural language processing etc. Availability: http://www.pubsqueezer.com</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG-CLIP : Learning EEG representations from natural language descriptions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16531v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained to solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/tidiane-camaret/EEGClip</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Localization of Blood Vessels in Retinal Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02962v1)** | 2024-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vessel structure is one of the most important parts of the retina which physicians can detect many diseases by analysing its features. Localization of blood vessels in retina images is an important process in medical image analysis. This process is also more challenging with the presence of bright and dark lesions. In this thesis, two automated vessel localization methods to handle both healthy and unhealthy (pathological) retina images are analyzed. Each method consists of two major steps and the second step is the same in the two methods. In the first step, an algorithm is used to decrease the effect of bright lesions. In Method 1, this algorithm is based on K- Means segmentation, and in Method 2, it is based on a regularization procedure. In the second step of both methods, a multi-scale line operator is used to localize the line-shaped vascular structures and ignore the dark lesions which are generally assumed to have irregular patterns. After the introduction of the methods, a detailed quantitative and qualitative comparison of the methods with one another as well as the state-of-the-art solutions in the literature based on the segmentation results on the images of the two publicly available datasets, DRIVE and STARE, is reported. The results demonstrate that the methods are highly comparable with other solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking White Blood Cell Classification Under Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01777v2)** | 2023-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recognizing the types of white blood cells (WBCs) in microscopic images of human blood smears is a fundamental task in the fields of pathology and hematology. Although previous studies have made significant contributions to the development of methods and datasets, few papers have investigated benchmarks or baselines that others can easily refer to. For instance, we observed notable variations in the reported accuracies of the same Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model across different studies, yet no public implementation exists to reproduce these results. In this paper, we establish a benchmark for WBC recognition. Our results indicate that CNN-based models achieve high accuracy when trained and tested under similar imaging conditions. However, their performance drops significantly when tested under different conditions. Moreover, the ResNet classifier, which has been widely employed in previous work, exhibits an unreasonably poor generalization ability under domain shifts due to batch normalization. We investigate this issue and suggest some alternative normalization techniques that can mitigate it. We make fully-reproducible code publicly available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apple2373/wbc-benchmark}}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2023.

| **[HSENet: Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network for 3D Medical Vision-Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09634v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space, facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering (73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

| **[Towards Scalable and Cross-Lingual Specialist Language Models for Oncology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08323v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical oncology generates vast, unstructured data that often contain inconsistencies, missing information, and ambiguities, making it difficult to extract reliable insights for data-driven decision-making. General-purpose large language models (LLMs) struggle with these challenges due to their lack of domain-specific reasoning, including specialized clinical terminology, context-dependent interpretations, and multi-modal data integration. We address these issues with an oncology-specialized, efficient, and adaptable NLP framework that combines instruction tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and graph-based knowledge integration. Our lightweight models prove effective at oncology-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition (e.g., identifying cancer diagnoses), entity linking (e.g., linking entities to standardized ontologies), TNM staging, document classification (e.g., cancer subtype classification from pathology reports), and treatment response prediction. Our framework emphasizes adaptability and resource efficiency. We include minimal German instructions, collected at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ), to test whether small amounts of non-English language data can effectively transfer knowledge across languages. This approach mirrors our motivation for lightweight models, which balance strong performance with reduced computational costs, making them suitable for resource-limited healthcare settings. We validated our models on oncology datasets, demonstrating strong results in named entity recognition, relation extraction, and document classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vertebrae localization, segmentation and identification using a graph optimization and an anatomic consistency cycle](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12177v3)** | 2022-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertebrae localization, segmentation and identification in CT images is key to numerous clinical applications. While deep learning strategies have brought to this field significant improvements over recent years, transitional and pathological vertebrae are still plaguing most existing approaches as a consequence of their poor representation in training datasets. Alternatively, proposed non-learning based methods take benefit of prior knowledge to handle such particular cases. In this work we propose to combine both strategies. To this purpose we introduce an iterative cycle in which individual vertebrae are recursively localized, segmented and identified using deep-networks, while anatomic consistency is enforced using statistical priors. In this strategy, the transitional vertebrae identification is handled by encoding their configurations in a graphical model that aggregates local deep-network predictions into an anatomically consistent final result. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the VerSe20 challenge benchmark, and outperforms all methods on transitional vertebrae as well as the generalization to the VerSe19 challenge benchmark. Furthermore, our method can detect and report inconsistent spine regions that do not satisfy the anatomic consistency priors. Our code and model are openly available for research purposes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Realistic Ultrasound Fetal Brain Imaging Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03941v1)** | 2023-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prenatal ultrasound imaging is the first-choice modality to assess fetal health. Medical image datasets for AI and ML methods must be diverse (i.e. diagnoses, diseases, pathologies, scanners, demographics, etc), however there are few public ultrasound fetal imaging datasets due to insufficient amounts of clinical data, patient privacy, rare occurrence of abnormalities in general practice, and limited experts for data collection and validation. To address such data scarcity, we proposed generative adversarial networks (GAN)-based models, diffusion-super-resolution-GAN and transformer-based-GAN, to synthesise images of fetal ultrasound brain planes from one public dataset. We reported that GAN-based methods can generate 256x256 pixel size of fetal ultrasound trans-cerebellum brain image plane with stable training losses, resulting in lower FID values for diffusion-super-resolution-GAN (average 7.04 and lower FID 5.09 at epoch 10) than the FID values of transformer-based-GAN (average 36.02 and lower 28.93 at epoch 60). The results of this work illustrate the potential of GAN-based methods to synthesise realistic high-resolution ultrasound images, leading to future work with other fetal brain planes, anatomies, devices and the need of a pool of experts to evaluate synthesised images.

| **[PRETI: Patient-Aware Retinal Foundation Model via Metadata-Guided Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.12233v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal foundation models have significantly advanced retinal image analysis by leveraging self-supervised learning to reduce dependence on labeled data while achieving strong generalization. Many recent approaches enhance retinal image understanding using report supervision, but obtaining clinical reports is often costly and challenging. In contrast, metadata (e.g., age, gender) is widely available and serves as a valuable resource for analyzing disease progression. To effectively incorporate patient-specific information, we propose PRETI, a retinal foundation model that integrates metadata-aware learning with robust self-supervised representation learning. We introduce Learnable Metadata Embedding (LME), which dynamically refines metadata representations. Additionally, we construct patient-level data pairs, associating images from the same individual to improve robustness against non-clinical variations. To further optimize retinal image representation, we propose Retina-Aware Adaptive Masking (RAAM), a strategy that selectively applies masking within the retinal region and dynamically adjusts the masking ratio during training. PRETI captures both global structures and fine-grained pathological details, resulting in superior diagnostic performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRETI achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse diseases and biomarker predictions using in-house and public data, indicating the importance of metadata-guided foundation models in retinal disease analysis.

The increasing availability of these social traces presents an interesting opportunity to enhance timeliness and efficiency of care. By collecting, analyzing and exploiting this information, it is possible to modify or in any case significantly improve our knowledge on the manifestation of a pathology and obtain a more detailed and nuanced vision of patients' experience, that we call the "social phenotype" of diseases. Materials and methods: In this paper we present a data analytic framework to represent, extract and analyze the social phenotype of diseases. To show the effectiveness of our methodology we presents a detailed case study on diabetes. First, we create a high quality data sample of diabetic patients' messages, extracted from popular medical forums during more than 10 years. Next, we use a topic extraction techniques based on latent analysis and word embeddings, to identify the main complications, the frequently reported symptoms and the common concerns of these patients. Results: We show that a freely manifested perception of a disease can be noticeably different from what is inferred from questionnaires, surveys and other common methodologies used to measure the impact of a disease on the patients' quality of life. In our case study on diabetes, we found that issues reported to have a daily impact on diabetic patients are diet, glycemic control, drugs and clinical tests. These problems are not commonly considered in Quality of Life assessments, since they are not perceived by doctors as representing severe limitations.</p></details> |  |

It has been widely used as a auxiliary imaging reference to detect eye-related pathology and predict longitudinal progression of the disease characteristics. Retina layer segmentation is one of the crucial feature extraction techniques, where the variations of retinal layer thicknesses and the retinal layer deformation due to the presence of the fluid are highly correlated with multiple epidemic eye diseases like Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). However, these images are acquired from different devices, which have different intensity distribution, or in other words, belong to different imaging domains. This paper proposes a segmentation-guided domain-adaptation method to adapt images from multiple devices into single image domain, where the state-of-art pre-trained segmentation model is available. It avoids the time consumption of manual labelling for the upcoming new dataset and the re-training of the existing network. The semantic consistency and global feature consistency of the network will minimize the hallucination effect that many researchers reported regarding Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks(CycleGAN) architecture.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

Introducing the RadPrompt Methodology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04121v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing imaging models capable of detecting pathologies from chest X-rays can be cost and time-prohibitive for large datasets as it requires supervision to attain state-of-the-art performance. Instead, labels extracted from radiology reports may serve as distant supervision since these are routinely generated as part of clinical practice. Despite their widespread use, current rule-based methods for label extraction rely on extensive rule sets that are limited in their robustness to syntactic variability. To alleviate these limitations, we introduce RadPert, a rule-based system that integrates an uncertainty-aware information schema with a streamlined set of rules, enhancing performance. Additionally, we have developed RadPrompt, a multi-turn prompting strategy that leverages RadPert to bolster the zero-shot predictive capabilities of large language models, achieving a statistically significant improvement in weighted average F1 score over GPT-4 Turbo. Most notably, RadPrompt surpasses both its underlying models, showcasing the synergistic potential of LLMs with rule-based models. We have evaluated our methods on two English Corpora: the MIMIC-CXR gold-standard test set and a gold-standard dataset collected from the Cambridge University Hospitals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BioNLP, ACL 2024</p></details> |

This can benefit Vietnamese radiologists and clinicians by annotating data that closely match their endemic diagnosis categories which may vary from country to country. To assess the efficacy of the proposed labeling technique, we built a CXR dataset containing 9,752 studies and evaluated our pipeline using a subset of this dataset. With an F1-score of at least 0.9923, the evaluation demonstrates that our labeling tool performs precisely and consistently across all classes. After building the dataset, we train deep learning models that leverage knowledge transferred from large public CXR datasets. We employ a variety of loss functions to overcome the curse of imbalanced multi-label datasets and conduct experiments with various model architectures to select the one that delivers the best performance. Our best model (CheXpert-pretrained EfficientNet-B2) yields an F1-score of 0.6989 (95% CI 0.6740, 0.7240), AUC of 0.7912, sensitivity of 0.7064 and specificity of 0.8760 for the abnormal diagnosis in general. Finally, we demonstrate that our coarse classification (based on five specific locations of abnormalities) yields comparable results to fine classification (twelve pathologies) on the benchmark CheXpert dataset for general anomaly detection while delivering better performance in terms of the average performance of all classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been provisionally accepted for publication by Plos One journal</p></details> |
| **[MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13085v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection method, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs. Our data and code are available in https://github.com/richard-peng-xia/MMed-RAG.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report in detail how pathologists navigate WSIs of prostate cancer as they accumulate information for their diagnoses. We collected slide navigation data (i.e., viewport location, magnification level, and time) from 13 pathologists in 2 groups (5 genitourinary (GU) specialists and 8 general pathologists) and generated visual attention heatmaps and scanpaths. Each pathologist examined five WSIs from the TCGA PRAD dataset, which were selected by a GU pathology specialist. We examined and analyzed the distributions of visual attention for each group of pathologists after each WSI was examined. To quantify the relationship between a pathologist's attention and evidence for cancer in the WSI, we obtained tumor annotations from a genitourinary specialist. We used these annotations to compute the overlap between the distribution of visual attention and annotated tumor region to identify strong correlations. Motivated by this analysis, we trained a deep learning model to predict visual attention on unseen WSIs. We find that the attention heatmaps predicted by our model correlate quite well with the ground truth attention heatmap and tumor annotations on a test set of 17 WSIs by using various spatial and temporal evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>ISBI ...</summary><p>ISBI 2022 (Oral presentation)</p></details> |

However, most medical imaging datasets are small and fragmented. In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can synthesize realistic/diverse additional training images to fill the data lack in the real image distribution; researchers have improved classification by augmenting data with noise-to-image (e.g., random noise samples to diverse pathological images) or image-to-image GANs (e.g., a benign image to a malignant one). Yet, no research has reported results combining noise-to-image and image-to-image GANs for further performance boost. Therefore, to maximize the DA effect with the GAN combinations, we propose a two-step GAN-based DA that generates and refines brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) images with/without tumors separately: (i) Progressive Growing of GANs (PGGANs), multi-stage noise-to-image GAN for high-resolution MR image generation, first generates realistic/diverse 256 X 256 images; (ii) Multimodal UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (MUNIT) that combines GANs/Variational AutoEncoders or SimGAN that uses a DA-focused GAN loss, further refines the texture/shape of the PGGAN-generated images similarly to the real ones. We thoroughly investigate CNN-based tumor classification results, also considering the influence of pre-training on ImageNet and discarding weird-looking GAN-generated images. The results show that, when combined with classic DA, our two-step GAN-based DA can significantly outperform the classic DA alone, in tumor detection (i.e., boosting sensitivity 93.67% to 97.48%) and also in other medical imaging tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, accepted to IEEE ACCESS</p></details> |

In the normal brain, new granule cells are generated from progenitors in the subgranular zone and integrate in a typical fashion. During the development of epilepsy, granule cell integration is profoundly altered. The new cells migrate to ectopic locations and develop misoriented basal dendrites. Although it has been established that these abnormal cells are newly generated, it is not known whether they arise ubiquitously throughout the progenitor cell pool or are derived from a smaller number of bad actor progenitors. To explore this question, we conducted a clonal analysis study in mice expressing the Brainbow fluorescent protein reporter construct in dentate granule cell progenitors. Mice were examined 2 months after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, a treatment that leads to the development of epilepsy. Brain sections were rendered translucent so that entire hippocampi could be reconstructed and all fluorescently labeled cells identified. Our findings reveal that a small number of progenitors produce the majority of ectopic cells following status epilepticus, indicating that either the affected progenitors or their local microenvironments have become pathological. By contrast, granule cells with basal dendrites were equally distributed among clonal groups. This indicates that these progenitors can produce normal cells and suggests that global factors sporadically disrupt the dendritic development of some new cells. Together, these findings strongly predict that distinct mechanisms regulate different aspects</p></details> | 44 pages, 6 figures |
| **[The discriminative functional mixture model for a comparative analysis of bike sharing systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.07999v1)** | 2016-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bike sharing systems (BSSs) have become a means of sustainable intermodal transport and are now proposed in many cities worldwide. Most BSSs also provide open access to their data, particularly to real-time status reports on their bike stations. The analysis of the mass of data generated by such systems is of particular interest to BSS providers to update system structures and policies. This work was motivated by interest in analyzing and comparing several European BSSs to identify common operating patterns in BSSs and to propose practical solutions to avoid potential issues. Our approach relies on the identification of common patterns between and within systems. To this end, a model-based clustering method, called FunFEM, for time series (or more generally functional data) is developed. It is based on a functional mixture model that allows the clustering of the data in a discriminative functional subspace. This model presents the advantage in this context to be parsimonious and to allow the visualization of the clustered systems. Numerical experiments confirm the good behavior of FunFEM, particularly compared to state-of-the-art methods. The application of FunFEM to BSS data from JCDecaux and the Transport for London Initiative allows us to identify 10 general patterns, including pathological ones, and to propose practical improvement strategies based on the system comparison. The visualization of the clustered data within the discriminative subspace turns out to be particularly informative regarding the system efficiency. The proposed methodology is implemented in a package for the R software, named funFEM, which is available on the CRAN. The package also provides a subset of the data analyzed in this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/15-AOAS861 in the Annals of Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Augmented Language Models Interpreting Structured Chest X-Ray Findings](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01711v1)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated interpretation of chest X-rays (CXR) is a critical task with the potential to significantly improve clinical workflow and patient care. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have shown promise, effectively leveraging the full power of large language models (LLMs) for this visual task remains an underexplored area. This paper introduces CXR-TextInter, a novel framework that repurposes powerful text-centric LLMs for CXR interpretation by operating solely on a rich, structured textual representation of the image content, generated by an upstream image analysis pipeline. We augment this LLM-centric approach with an integrated medical knowledge module to enhance clinical reasoning. To facilitate training and evaluation, we developed the MediInstruct-CXR dataset, containing structured image representations paired with diverse, clinically relevant instruction-response examples, and the CXR-ClinEval benchmark for comprehensive assessment across various interpretation tasks. Extensive experiments on CXR-ClinEval demonstrate that CXR-TextInter achieves state-of-the-art quantitative performance across pathology detection, report generation, and visual question answering, surpassing existing multimodal foundation models. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of the knowledge integration module. Furthermore, blinded human evaluation by board-certified radiologists shows a significant preference for the clinical quality of outputs generated by CXR-TextInter. Our work validates an alternative paradigm for medical image AI, showcasing the potential of harnessing advanced LLM capabilities when visual information is effectively structured and domain knowledge is integrated.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynCLay: Interactive Synthesis of Histology Images from Bespoke Cellular Layouts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13780v1)** | 2022-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated synthesis of histology images has several potential applications in computational pathology. However, no existing method can generate realistic tissue images with a bespoke cellular layout or user-defined histology parameters. In this work, we propose a novel framework called SynCLay (Synthesis from Cellular Layouts) that can construct realistic and high-quality histology images from user-defined cellular layouts along with annotated cellular boundaries. Tissue image generation based on bespoke cellular layouts through the proposed framework allows users to generate different histological patterns from arbitrary topological arrangement of different types of cells. SynCLay generated synthetic images can be helpful in studying the role of different types of cells present in the tumor microenvironmet. Additionally, they can assist in balancing the distribution of cellular counts in tissue images for designing accurate cellular composition predictors by minimizing the effects of data imbalance. We train SynCLay in an adversarial manner and integrate a nuclear segmentation and classification model in its training to refine nuclear structures and generate nuclear masks in conjunction with synthetic images. During inference, we combine the model with another parametric model for generating colon images and associated cellular counts as annotations given the grade of differentiation and cell densities of different cells. We assess the generated images quantitatively and report on feedback from trained pathologists who assigned realism scores to a set of images generated by the framework. The average realism score across all pathologists for synthetic images was as high as that for the real images. We also show that augmenting limited real data with the synthetic data generated by our framework can significantly boost prediction performance of the cellular composition prediction task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Brain covariance selection: better individual functional connectivity models using population prior](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.5071v4)** | 2010-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spontaneous brain activity, as observed in functional neuroimaging, has been shown to display reproducible structure that expresses brain architecture and carries markers of brain pathologies. An important view of modern neuroscience is that such large-scale structure of coherent activity reflects modularity properties of brain connectivity graphs. However, to date, there has been no demonstration that the limited and noisy data available in spontaneous activity observations could be used to learn full-brain probabilistic models that generalize to new data. Learning such models entails two main challenges: i) modeling full brain connectivity is a difficult estimation problem that faces the curse of dimensionality and ii) variability between subjects, coupled with the variability of functional signals between experimental runs, makes the use of multiple datasets challenging. We describe subject-level brain functional connectivity structure as a multivariate Gaussian process and introduce a new strategy to estimate it from group data, by imposing a common structure on the graphical model in the population. We show that individual models learned from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data using this population prior generalize better to unseen data than models based on alternative regularization schemes. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a cross-validated model of spontaneous brain activity. Finally, we use the estimated graphical model to explore the large-scale characteristics of functional architecture and show for the first time that known cognitive networks appear as the integrated communities of functional connectivity graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Ad...</summary><p>in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, Vancouver : Canada (2010)</p></details> |
| **[SpineBench: A Clinically Salient, Level-Aware Benchmark Powered by the SpineMed-450k Corpus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03160v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive learning has emerged as an effective method to extract critical lesion features from mammograms, thereby offering a potent tool for breast cancer screening and analysis. A crucial aspect of contrastive learning involves negative sampling, where the selection of appropriate hard negative samples is essential for driving representations to retain detailed information about lesions. In contrastive learning, it is often assumed that features can sufficiently capture semantic content, and that each minibatch inherently includes ideal hard negative samples. However, the characteristics of breast lumps challenge these assumptions. In response, we introduce ManiNeg, a novel approach that leverages manifestations as proxies to mine hard negative samples. Manifestations, which refer to the observable symptoms or signs of a disease, provide a knowledge-driven and robust basis for choosing hard negative samples. This approach benefits from its invariance to model optimization, facilitating efficient sampling. To support ManiNeg and future research endeavors, we developed the MVKL dataset, which includes multi-view mammograms, corresponding reports, meticulously annotated manifestations, and pathologically confirmed benign-malignant outcomes. We evaluate ManiNeg on the benign and malignant classification task. Our results demonstrate that ManiNeg not only improves representation in both unimodal and multimodal contexts but also shows generalization across datasets. The MVKL dataset and our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/wxwxwwxxx/ManiNeg.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Reconstruction of Magnetic Resonance Images using Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13700v1)** | 2023-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A central goal of modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is to reduce the time required to produce high-quality images. Efforts have included hardware and software innovations such as parallel imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning-based reconstruction. Here, we propose and demonstrate a Bayesian method to build statistical libraries of magnetic resonance (MR) images in k-space and use these libraries to identify optimal subsampling paths and reconstruction processes. Specifically, we compute a multivariate normal distribution based upon Gaussian processes using a publicly available library of T1-weighted images of healthy brains. We combine this library with physics-informed envelope functions to only retain meaningful correlations in k-space. This covariance function is then used to select a series of ring-shaped subsampling paths using Bayesian optimization such that they optimally explore space while remaining practically realizable in commercial MRI systems. Combining optimized subsampling paths found for a range of images, we compute a generalized sampling path that, when used for novel images, produces superlative structural similarity and error in comparison to previously reported reconstruction processes (i.e. 96.3% structural similarity and <0.003 normalized mean squared error from sampling only 12.5% of the k-space data). Finally, we use this reconstruction process on pathological data without retraining to show that reconstructed images are clinically useful for stroke identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmenting Chest X-ray Datasets with Non-Expert Annotations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02244v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of machine learning algorithms in medical image analysis requires the expansion of training datasets. A popular and cost-effective approach is automated annotation extraction from free-text medical reports, primarily due to the high costs associated with expert clinicians annotating medical images, such as chest X-rays. However, it has been shown that the resulting datasets are susceptible to biases and shortcuts. Another strategy to increase the size of a dataset is crowdsourcing, a widely adopted practice in general computer vision with some success in medical image analysis. In a similar vein to crowdsourcing, we enhance two publicly available chest X-ray datasets by incorporating non-expert annotations. However, instead of using diagnostic labels, we annotate shortcuts in the form of tubes. We collect 3.5k chest drain annotations for NIH-CXR14, and 1k annotations for four different tube types in PadChest, and create the Non-Expert Annotations of Tubes in X-rays (NEATX) dataset. We train a chest drain detector with the non-expert annotations that generalizes well to expert labels. Moreover, we compare our annotations to those provided by experts and show "moderate" to "almost perfect" agreement. Finally, we present a pathology agreement study to raise awareness about the quality of ground truth annotations. We make our dataset available on Zenodo at https://zenodo.org/records/14944064 and our code available at https://github.com/purrlab/chestxr-label-reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Image Understanding and Analysis Conference - MIUA 2025</p></details> |

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes and olfactory epithelial cells are likely under-appreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, correlating with reported loss of sense of taste and smell as early indicators of COVID-19 infection, including in otherwise asymptomatic patients. Airway club cells, ciliated cells and type II pneumocytes in the lung, and enterocytes of the gut also express ACE2. This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.</p></details> | 5 figures |

Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21191v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The procedure involves photocoagulation pathological anastomoses to regulate blood exchange among twins. The procedure is particularly challenging due to the limited field of view, poor manoeuvrability of the fetoscope, poor visibility, and variability in illumination. These challenges may lead to increased surgery time and incomplete ablation. Computer-assisted intervention (CAI) can provide surgeons with decision support and context awareness by identifying key structures in the scene and expanding the fetoscopic field of view through video mosaicking. Research in this domain has been hampered by the lack of high-quality data to design, develop and test CAI algorithms. Through the Fetoscopic Placental Vessel Segmentation and Registration (FetReg2021) challenge, which was organized as part of the MICCAI2021 Endoscopic Vision challenge, we released the first largescale multicentre TTTS dataset for the development of generalized and robust semantic segmentation and video mosaicking algorithms. For this challenge, we released a dataset of 2060 images, pixel-annotated for vessels, tool, fetus and background classes, from 18 in-vivo TTTS fetoscopy procedures and 18 short video clips. Seven teams participated in this challenge and their model performance was assessed on an unseen test dataset of 658 pixel-annotated images from 6 fetoscopic procedures and 6 short clips. The challenge provided an opportunity for creating generalized solutions for fetoscopic scene understanding and mosaicking. In this paper, we present the findings of the FetReg2021 challenge alongside reporting a detailed literature review for CAI in TTTS fetoscopy. Through this challenge, its analysis and the release of multi-centre fetoscopic data, we provide a benchmark for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MedIA (Medical Image Analysis)</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored. In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with 1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types, including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering, and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a 24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model, benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at https://github.com/isbrycee/OralGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 26 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

However, such algorithms require vast amounts of annotated training data, which are typically not available in the medical context due to data privacy, legal obstructions, and non-uniform data acquisition protocols. Synthetic databases with annotated pathologies could provide the required amounts of training data. We demonstrate with the example of ischemic stroke that an improvement in lesion segmentation is feasible using deep learning based augmentation. To this end, we train different image-to-image translation models to synthesize magnetic resonance images of brain volumes with and without stroke lesions from semantic segmentation maps. In addition, we train a generative adversarial network to generate synthetic lesion masks. Subsequently, we combine these two components to build a large database of synthetic stroke images. The performance of the various models is evaluated using a U-Net which is trained to segment stroke lesions on a clinical test set. We report a Dice score of $\mathbf{72.8}$% [$\mathbf{70.8\pm1.0}$%] for the model with the best performance, which outperforms the model trained on the clinical images alone $\mathbf{67.3}$% [$\mathbf{63.2\pm1.9}$%], and is close to the human inter-reader Dice score of $\mathbf{76.9}$%. Moreover, we show that for a small database of only 10 or 50 clinical cases, synthetic data augmentation yields significant improvement compared to a setting where no synthetic data is used. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first comparative analysis of synthetic data augmentation based on image-to-image translation, and first application to ischemic stroke.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages; 9 figures; 2 tables; content matches published version</p></details> |

However, the initial attempts to transfer this new paradigm to medical imaging have shown less impressive performances than those observed in other domains, due to the significant domain shift and the complex, expert domain knowledge inherent to medical-imaging tasks. Motivated by the need for domain-expert foundation models, we present FLAIR, a pre-trained vision-language model for universal retinal fundus image understanding. To this end, we compiled 38 open-access, mostly categorical fundus imaging datasets from various sources, with up to 101 different target conditions and 288,307 images. We integrate the expert's domain knowledge in the form of descriptive textual prompts, during both pre-training and zero-shot inference, enhancing the less-informative categorical supervision of the data. Such a textual expert's knowledge, which we compiled from the relevant clinical literature and community standards, describes the fine-grained features of the pathologies as well as the hierarchies and dependencies between them. We report comprehensive evaluations, which illustrate the benefit of integrating expert knowledge and the strong generalization capabilities of FLAIR under difficult scenarios with domain shifts or unseen categories. When adapted with a lightweight linear probe, FLAIR outperforms fully-trained, dataset-focused models, more so in the few-shot regimes. Interestingly, FLAIR outperforms by a wide margin larger-scale generalist image-language models and retina domain-specific self-supervised networks, which emphasizes the potential of embedding experts' domain knowledge and the limitations of generalist models in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Medical Image Analysis.

Next to the Bayesian fully convolutional neural network, we also present inherent measures of segmentation uncertainty that allow for quality control per brain structure. For estimating model uncertainty, we follow a Bayesian approach, wherein, Monte Carlo (MC) samples from the posterior distribution are generated by keeping the dropout layers active at test time. Entropy over the MC samples provides a voxel-wise model uncertainty map, whereas expectation over the MC predictions provides the final segmentation. Next to voxel-wise uncertainty, we introduce four metrics to quantify structure-wise uncertainty in segmentation for quality control. We report experiments on four out-of-sample datasets comprising of diverse age range, pathology and imaging artifacts. The proposed structure-wise uncertainty metrics are highly correlated with the Dice score estimated with manual annotation and therefore present an inherent measure of segmentation quality. In particular, the intersection over union over all the MC samples is a suitable proxy for the Dice score. In addition to quality control at scan-level, we propose to incorporate the structure-wise uncertainty as a measure of confidence to do reliable group analysis on large data repositories. We envisage that the introduced uncertainty metrics would help assess the fidelity of automated deep learning based segmentation methods for large-scale population studies, as they enable automated quality control and group analyses in processing large data repositories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review in NeuroImage</p></details> |

Although chest radiography (CXR) is more accessible and safer, existing CXR foundation models focus primarily on detecting diseases that are readily visible on the CXR. Recently, works have explored training disease classification models on simulated CXRs, but they remain limited to recognizing a single disease type from CT. CT foundation models have also emerged with significantly improved detection of pathologies in CT. However, the generalized application of CT-derived labels on CXR has remained illusive. In this study, we propose X2CT-CLIP, a tri-modal knowledge transfer learning framework that bridges the modality gap between CT and CXR while reducing the computational burden of model training. Our approach is the first work to enable multi-abnormality classification in CT, using CXR, by transferring knowledge from 3D CT volumes and associated radiology reports to a CXR encoder via a carefully designed tri-modal alignment mechanism in latent space. Extensive evaluations on three multi-label CT datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cross-modal retrieval, few-shot adaptation, and external validation. These results highlight the potential of CXR, enriched with knowledge derived from CT, as a viable efficient alternative for disease detection in resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Enriched Annotations for Tumor Attribute Classification from Pathology Reports with Limited Labeled Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08113v1)** | 2020-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision medicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but much of the data for patients is locked away in unstructured free-text, limiting research and delivery of effective personalized treatments. Generating large annotated datasets for information extraction from clinical notes is often challenging and expensive due to the high level of expertise needed for high quality annotations. To enable natural language processing for small dataset sizes, we develop a novel enriched hierarchical annotation scheme and algorithm, Supervised Line Attention (SLA), and apply this algorithm to predicting categorical tumor attributes from kidney and colon cancer pathology reports from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Whereas previous work only annotated document level labels, we in addition ask the annotators to enrich the traditional label by asking them to also highlight the relevant line or potentially lines for the final label, which leads to a 20% increase of annotation time required per document. With the enriched annotations, we develop a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm that first predicts the relevant lines in the document and then predicts the tumor attribute. Our results show across the small dataset sizes of 32, 64, 128, and 186 labeled documents per cancer, SLA only requires half the number of labeled documents as state-of-the-art methods to achieve similar or better micro-f1 and macro-f1 scores for the vast majority of comparisons that we made. Accounting for the increased annotation time, this leads to a 40% reduction in total annotation time over the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Artificial Intelligence with Real-time Intracranial EEG Monitoring to Automate Interictal Identification of Seizure Onset Zones in Focal Epilepsy](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06234v1)** | 2018-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An ability to map seizure-generating brain tissue, i.e., the seizure onset zone (SOZ), without recording actual seizures could reduce the duration of invasive EEG monitoring for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A widely-adopted practice in the literature is to compare the incidence (events/time) of putative pathological electrophysiological biomarkers associated with epileptic brain tissue with the SOZ determined from spontaneous seizures recorded with intracranial EEG, primarily using a single biomarker. Clinical translation of the previous efforts suffers from their inability to generalize across multiple patients because of (a) the inter-patient variability and (b) the temporal variability in the epileptogenic activity. Here, we report an artificial intelligence-based approach for combining multiple interictal electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics as a way of accounting for the above barriers and show that it can reliably identify seizure onset zones in a study cohort of 82 patients who underwent evaluation for drug-resistant epilepsy. Our investigation provides evidence that utilizing the complementary information provided by multiple electrophysiological biomarkers and their temporal characteristics can significantly improve the localization potential compared to previously published single-biomarker incidence-based approaches, resulting in an average area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.73 in a cohort of 82 patients. Our results also suggest that recording durations between ninety minutes and two hours are sufficient to localize SOZs with accuracies that may prove clinically relevant. The successful validation of our approach on a large cohort of 82 patients warrants future investigation on the feasibility of utilizing intra-operative EEG monitoring and artificial intelligence to localize epileptogenic brain tissue.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, Journal of neural engineering (2018)</p></details> |
| **[WSSS4LUAD: Grand Challenge on Weakly-supervised Tissue Semantic Segmentation for Lung Adenocarcinoma](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06455v2)** | 2022-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common subtype. Exploiting the potential value of the histopathology images can promote precision medicine in oncology. Tissue segmentation is the basic upstream task of histopathology image analysis. Existing deep learning models have achieved superior segmentation performance but require sufficient pixel-level annotations, which is time-consuming and expensive. To enrich the label resources of LUAD and to alleviate the annotation efforts, we organize this challenge WSSS4LUAD to call for the outstanding weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) techniques for histopathology images of LUAD. Participants have to design the algorithm to segment tumor epithelial, tumor-associated stroma and normal tissue with only patch-level labels. This challenge includes 10,091 patch-level annotations (the training set) and over 130 million labeled pixels (the validation and test sets), from 87 WSIs (67 from GDPH, 20 from TCGA). All the labels were generated by a pathologist-in-the-loop pipeline with the help of AI models and checked by the label review board. Among 532 registrations, 28 teams submitted the results in the test phase with over 1,000 submissions. Finally, the first place team achieved mIoU of 0.8413 (tumor: 0.8389, stroma: 0.7931, normal: 0.8919). According to the technical reports of the top-tier teams, CAM is still the most popular approach in WSSS. Cutmix data augmentation has been widely adopted to generate more reliable samples. With the success of this challenge, we believe that WSSS approaches with patch-level annotations can be a complement to the traditional pixel annotations while reducing the annotation efforts. The entire dataset has been released to encourage more researches on computational pathology in LUAD and more novel WSSS techniques.</p></details> |  |

Method: We analyzed 2,258 colonoscopy images with corresponding pathology reports from 428 patients. We preprocessed all images using standardized techniques (resizing, normalization, and augmentation) and implemented a rigorous comparative framework evaluating 11 distinct models: ResNet50, 4 CMLs (random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree), two specialized contrastive vision language encoders (CLIP, BiomedCLIP), and three general-purpose VLMs ( GPT-4 Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus). Our performance assessment focused on two clinical tasks: polyp detection (CADe) and classification (CADx). Result: In polyp detection, ResNet50 achieved the best performance (F1: 91.35%, AUROC: 0.98), followed by BiomedCLIP (F1: 88.68%, AUROC: [AS1] ). GPT-4 demonstrated comparable effectiveness to traditional machine learning approaches (F1: 81.02%, AUROC: [AS2] ), outperforming other general-purpose VLMs. For polyp classification, performance rankings remained consistent but with lower overall metrics. ResNet50 maintained the highest efficacy (weighted F1: 74.94%), while GPT-4 demonstrated moderate capability (weighted F1: 41.18%), significantly exceeding other VLMs (Claude-3-Opus weighted F1: 25.54%, Gemini 1.5 Pro weighted F1: 6.17%). Conclusion: CNNs remain superior for both CADx and CADe tasks. However, VLMs like BioMedCLIP and GPT-4 may be useful for polyp detection tasks where training CNNs is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/aminkhalafi/CML-vs-LLM-on-Polyp-Detection.

However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations, facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect 16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data. Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12 independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification, information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously difficult in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Segmentation of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Images: Benchmark Data and Clinically Relevant Metrics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.09978v2)** | 2020-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel non-invasive imaging modality for the visualisation of microvasculature in vivo that has encountered broad adoption in retinal research. OCTA potential in the assessment of pathological conditions and the reproducibility of studies relies on the quality of the image analysis. However, automated segmentation of parafoveal OCTA images is still an open problem. In this study, we generate the first open dataset of retinal parafoveal OCTA images with associated ground truth manual segmentations. Furthermore, we establish a standard for OCTA image segmentation by surveying a broad range of state-of-the-art vessel enhancement and binarisation procedures. We provide the most comprehensive comparison of these methods under a unified framework to date. Our results show that, for the set of images considered, deep learning architectures (U-Net and CS-Net) achieve the best performance. For applications where manually segmented data is not available to retrain these approaches, our findings suggest that optimal oriented flux is the best handcrafted filter from those considered. Furthermore, we report on the importance of preserving network structure in the segmentation to enable deep vascular phenotyping. We introduce new metrics for network structure evaluation in segmented angiograms. Our results demonstrate that segmentation methods with equal Dice score perform very differently in terms of network structure preservation. Moreover, we compare the error in the computation of clinically relevant vascular network metrics (e.g. foveal avascular zone area and vessel density) across segmentation methods. Our results show up to 25% differences in vessel density accuracy depending on the segmentation method employed.

However, despite their promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1) enables physicians to manually select and use different models without programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs (Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases, yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent pathology terminology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Self-supervised Learning: Towards Universal Multi-modal Medical Data Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17597v2)** | 2023-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning is an efficient pre-training method for medical image analysis. However, current research is mostly confined to specific-modality data pre-training, consuming considerable time and resources without achieving universality across different modalities. A straightforward solution is combining all modality data for joint self-supervised pre-training, which poses practical challenges. Firstly, our experiments reveal conflicts in representation learning as the number of modalities increases. Secondly, multi-modal data collected in advance cannot cover all real-world scenarios. In this paper, we reconsider versatile self-supervised learning from the perspective of continual learning and propose MedCoSS, a continuous self-supervised learning approach for multi-modal medical data. Unlike joint self-supervised learning, MedCoSS assigns different modality data to different training stages, forming a multi-stage pre-training process. To balance modal conflicts and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose a rehearsal-based continual learning method. We introduce the k-means sampling strategy to retain data from previous modalities and rehearse it when learning new modalities. Instead of executing the pretext task on buffer data, a feature distillation strategy and an intra-modal mixup strategy are applied to these data for knowledge retention. We conduct continuous self-supervised pre-training on a large-scale multi-modal unlabeled dataset, including clinical reports, X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, and pathological images. Experimental results demonstrate MedCoSS's exceptional generalization ability across nine downstream datasets and its significant scalability in integrating new modality data.
