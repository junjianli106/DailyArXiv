| **[Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution, we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics, including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels. Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate translation towards routine use by pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORE - A Cell-Level Coarse-to-Fine Image Registration Engine for Multi-stain Image Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03826v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  |
| **[Positive Semi-definite Latent Factor Grouping-Boosted Cluster-reasoning Instance Disentangled Learning for WSI Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01304v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been widely used for representing whole-slide pathology images. However, spatial, semantic, and decision entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling. Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent decision-making process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/Prince-Lee-PathAI/PG-CIDL</p></details> |
| **[SurGen: 1020 H&E-stained Whole Slide Images With Survival and Genetic Markers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04946v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Comprehensive datasets that combine histopathological images with genetic and survival data across various tumour sites are essential for advancing computational pathology and personalised medicine. We present SurGen, a dataset comprising 1,020 H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) from 843 colorectal cancer cases. The dataset includes detailed annotations for key genetic mutations (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) and mismatch repair status, as well as survival data for 426 cases. We illustrate SurGen's utility with a proof-of-concept model that predicts mismatch repair status directly from WSIs, achieving a test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8273. These preliminary results underscore the dataset's potential to facilitate research in biomarker discovery, prognostic modelling, and advanced machine learning applications in colorectal cancer and beyond. SurGen offers a valuable resource for the scientific community, enabling studies that require high-quality WSIs linked with comprehensive clinical and genetic information on colorectal cancer. Our initial findings affirm the dataset's capacity to advance diagnostic precision and foster the development of personalised treatment strategies in colorectal oncology.

| **[STARC-9: A Large-scale Dataset for Multi-Class Tissue Classification for CRC Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00383v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-class tissue-type classification of colorectal cancer (CRC) histopathologic images is a significant step in the development of downstream machine learning models for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, existing public CRC datasets often lack morphologic diversity, suffer from class imbalance, and contain low-quality image tiles, limiting model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford coloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue classification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image tiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000 tiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++, designed to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an encoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors from tiles within each whole-slide image. Then, K-means clustering groups morphologically similar tiles, followed by equal-frequency binning to sample diverse morphologic patterns within each class. The selected tiles are subsequently verified by expert gastrointestinal pathologists to ensure accuracy. This semi-automated process significantly reduces manual effort while producing high-quality, diverse tiles. To evaluate STARC-9, we benchmarked convolutional neural networks, transformers, and pathology-specific foundation models on multi-class CRC tissue classification and segmentation tasks, showing superior generalizability compared to models trained on existing datasets. Although we demonstrate the utility of DeepCluster++ on CRC as a pilot use-case, it is a flexible framework that can be used for constructing high-quality datasets from large WSI repositories across a wide range of cancer and non-cancer applications.</p></details> | 37 pages, 18 figures |
| **[PRISM2: Unlocking Multi-Modal General Pathology AI with Clinical Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13063v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rapid progress in the field of computational pathology has been enabled by foundation models. These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Heterogeneous Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27237v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs. However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Eye-Tracking, Mouse Tracking, Stimulus Tracking,and Decision-Making Datasets in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24653v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both pathologists and AI systems that might support human experts. All experiments were preregistered at https://osf.io/hj9a7, and the complete dataset along with analysis code is available at https://go.osu.edu/pathogaze.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, submitted to Nature Scientific Data</p></details> |
| **[CPathAgent: An Agent-based Foundation Model for Interpretable High-Resolution Pathology Image Analysis Mimicking Pathologists' Diagnostic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20510v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.</p></details> | 52 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Accurate and Scalable Multimodal Pathology Retrieval via Attentive Vision-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23224v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iris RESTful Server and IrisTileSource: An Iris implementation for existing OpenSeaDragon viewers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06615v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Iris File Extension (IFE) is a low overhead performance-oriented whole slide image (WSI) file format designed to improve the image rendering experience for pathologists and simplify image management for system administrators. However, static hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) file servers cannot natively stream subregions of high-resolution image files, such as the IFE. The majority of contemporary WSI viewer systems are designed as browser-based web applications and leverage OpenSeaDragon as the tile-based rendering framework. These systems convert WSI files to Deep Zoom Images (DZI) for compatibility with simple static HTTP file servers. To address this limitation, we have developed the Iris RESTful Server, a low-overhead HTTP server with a RESTful API that is natively compatible with the DICOMweb WADO-RS API. Written in C++ with Boost Beast HTTP and Asio networking libraries atop the public IFE libraries, the server offers both security and high performance. Testing shows that a single Raspberry Pi equivalent system can handle a peak of 5,061 req/s (average 3,883 req/s) with a median latency of 21 ms on a private (i.e. hospital) network. We also developed and merged a new OpenSeaDragon TileSource, compatible with the Iris RESTful API, into the next OpenSeaDragon release, enabling simple and immediate drop-in replacement of DZI images within WSI viewer stacks. Designed as a secure cross-origin resource sharing microservice, this architecture includes detailed deployment instructions for new or existing WSI workflows, and the public examples.restful.irisdigitalpathology.org subdomain is provided as a development tool to accelerate WSI web viewer development. All relevant Iris software is available under the open-source MIT software license.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models in Dermatopathology: Skin Tissue Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21664v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17982v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data. The code is available at https://github.com/bryanwong17/HiVE-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Interactive visualization of kidney micro-compartmental segmentations and associated pathomics on whole slide images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19499v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application of machine learning techniques enables segmentation of functional tissue units in histology whole-slide images (WSIs). We built a pipeline to apply previously validated segmentation models of kidney structures and extract quantitative features from these structures. Such quantitative analysis also requires qualitative inspection of results for quality control, exploration, and communication. We extend the Vitessce web-based visualization tool to enable visualization of segmentations of multiple types of functional tissue units, such as, glomeruli, tubules, arteries/arterioles in the kidney. Moreover, we propose a standard representation for files containing multiple segmentation bitmasks, which we define polymorphically, such that existing formats including OME-TIFF, OME-NGFF, AnnData, MuData, and SpatialData can be used. We demonstrate that these methods enable researchers and the broader public to interactively explore datasets containing multiple segmented entities and associated features, including for exploration of renal morphometry of biopsies from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flow Model with Low-Rank Transformers for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21829v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete modalities scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15138v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semiparametric Gaussian Mixture Model with Spatial Dependence and Its Application to Whole-Slide Image Clustering Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16421v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop here a semiparametric Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) for unsupervised learning with valuable spatial information taken into consideration. Specifically, we assume for each instance a random location. Then, conditional on this random location, we assume for the feature vector a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed SGMM allows the mixing probability to be nonparametrically related to the spatial location. Compared with a classical GMM, SGMM is considerably more flexible and allows the instances from the same class to be spatially clustered. To estimate the SGMM, novel EM algorithms are developed and rigorous asymptotic theories are established. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate our finite sample performance. For a real application, we apply our SGMM method to the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images (WSIs) for breast cancer detection. The SGMM method demonstrates outstanding clustering performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCMIL: A Progressive Representation Learning of Whole Slide Images for Cancer Prognosis Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14403v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/tuuuc/DCMIL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Morphology-Aware Prognostic model for Five-Year Survival Prediction in Colorectal Cancer from H&E Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14800v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally, with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%; HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens, replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between treatments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Survival Modeling from Whole Slide Images via Patch-Level Graph Clustering and Mixture Density Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16476v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly, to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly, we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$ and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method across diverse cancer types.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPADE: Spatial Transcriptomics and Pathology Alignment Using a Mixture of Data Experts for an Expressive Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21857v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMAP: A Multi-Magnification and Prototype-Aware Architecture for Predicting Spatial Gene Expression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11344v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Generalisation of automatic tumour segmentation in histopathological whole-slide images across multiple cancer types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11182v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06113v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications.

| **[A Hierarchical Geometry-guided Transformer for Histological Subtyping of Primary Liver Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05657v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, accepted by IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11846v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientMIL: Efficient Linear-Complexity MIL Method for WSI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23640v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.</p></details> | Submitted to Array |
| **[Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/16812932 , our code is available at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/beetle , and our benchmark is available at https://beetle.grand-challenge.org/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic and Visual Crop-Guided Diffusion Models for Heterogeneous Tissue Synthesis in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17847v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPLE: Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25863v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI) classification by aligning visual features with textual representations, thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization. Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</p></details> |  |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm where one cancer corresponds to one model. However, it naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot utilize the knowledge of other cancers. Although a multi-task learning-like framework has been studied recently, it usually has high demands on computational resources and needs considerable costs in iterative training on ultra-large multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper makes a paradigm shift to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It has three major parts: (i) we curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors); (ii) beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmark, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of transferability; (iii) we further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. We hope CROPKT could serve as an inception and lay the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients. Code and data are available at https://github.com/panliangrui/NIPS2025/.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is being withdrawn because we identified issues in the analysis that may affect the results.

| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025. Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[IPGPhormer: Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer for Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12381v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ME-Mamba: Multi-Expert Mamba with Efficient Knowledge Capture and Fusion for Multimodal Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16900v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer research. Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with >92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang9/Rasa.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCORPION: Addressing Scanner-Induced Variability in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20907v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UNSURE 2025 workshop in MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Cluster-Level Sparse Multi-Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11034v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering, within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones. This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles. Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).</p></details> | 12 pages,5 figures |
| **[OCELOT 2023: Cell Detection from Cell-Tissue Interaction Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09153v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses. However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted manuscript of an article published in Medical Image Analysis (Elsevier).

However, existing open-source tools are often distributed as source code or Docker containers, requiring advanced programming skills that hinder accessibility for non-programmers, such as clinicians. Additionally, current models are typically trained on a single dataset and lack flexibility in adjusting confidence levels for predictions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GloFinder, a QuPath plugin designed for single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs with online editing through the graphical user interface (GUI). GloFinder employs CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework utilizing circle representations for precise object localization, with models trained on approximately 160,000 manually annotated glomeruli. To further enhance accuracy, the plugin incorporates Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), an ensemble method that combines confidence scores from multiple CircleNet models to produce refined predictions, achieving superior performance in glomerular detection. GloFinder enables direct visualization and editing of results in QuPath, facilitating seamless interaction for clinicians and providing a powerful tool for nephropathology research and clinical practice.

However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing content generation models in computational pathology.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures.

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable and Loosely-Coupled Multimodal Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03408v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records, and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities, making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.</p></details> |  |
| **[MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia, chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima. Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</p></details> |  |

The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

These images can be viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science. When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects. We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs. Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes. We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.</p></details> |  |

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted precision oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/lilab-stanford/ELF)</p></details> |

However, pathology images from different hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features, posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Pathology Co-pilot via Reasoning Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17303v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 Figures |

A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations.

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance.

Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms.

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation (AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16 dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times.

However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.</p></details> |  |

LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

| **[Welcome New Doctor: Continual Learning with Expert Consultation and Autoregressive Inference for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02220v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Mamba for Efficient Whole Slide Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17457v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Conventional patch-based methods inevitably distort spatial relationships or treat patches as independent samples, while traditional attention mechanisms, designed for dense, uniformly distributed data, are computationally impractical for WSIs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse-native computational framework that preserves exact spatial relationships, unlocking advanced modeling techniques and bridging a long-standing gap between WSI analysis and general vision. Based on this framework, we develop Sparse Pyramid Attention Networks (SPAN), incorporating a hierarchical sparse pyramid attention architecture with shifted windows that efficiently directs computational resources to informative regions. SPAN comprises two key modules: Spatial-Adaptive Feature Condensation, which progressively builds multi-scale representations from a single-scale input through sparse downsampling, and Context-Aware Feature Refinement, which captures long-range dependencies via shifted windows and global tokens. Evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate SPAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating both our framework's effectiveness and SPAN's specific advantages in capturing contextual and hierachical representations that existing methods fundamentally cannot model. Our work establishes a new paradigm for WSI analysis that overcomes long-standing computational barriers. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We developed methods to predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists' attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Medical Image Analysis (MEDIA), Elsevier, 2025.

| **[Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[$MV_{Hybrid}$: Improving Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction with Hybrid State Space-Vision Transformer Backbone in Pathology Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00383v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745). Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged 0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little focus on clinical utility.

Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, a critical limitation of current MIL methods lies in the underutilization of pre-training for the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches initialize the aggregator randomly and train it from scratch, making performance highly sensitive to the quantity of labeled WSIs and ignoring the abundance of unlabeled WSIs commonly available in clinical settings. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating PreMix as a plug-in module into HIPT yields an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training sizes and datasets. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i) multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides, with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection, and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides.

Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |

SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text, 2 page references, 2 page appendix; under submission</p></details> |

While recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models. Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods.

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces DepViT-CAD, a deployable AI system for multi-class cancer diagnosis in histopathology. At its core is MAViT, a novel Multi-Attention Vision Transformer designed to capture fine-grained morphological patterns across diverse tumor types. MAViT was trained on expert-annotated patches from 1008 whole-slide images, covering 11 diagnostic categories, including 10 major cancers and non-tumor tissue. DepViT-CAD was validated on two independent cohorts: 275 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 50 routine clinical cases from pathology labs, achieving diagnostic sensitivities of 94.11% and 92%, respectively. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architecture with large-scale real-world validation, DepViT-CAD offers a robust and scalable approach for AI-assisted cancer diagnostics.

| **[Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08178v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/MIL-JigsawPuzzles.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20653v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[MeD-3D: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Precise Recurrence Prediction in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07839v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular, pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing.</p></details> |  |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05077v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Automatic Data Curation for Vision Foundation Models in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18709v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02395v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance. To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD) module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF) strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in survival prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLa: Hierarchical Vision-Language Collaboration for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04613v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language (VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment. Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation (CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving over 20% in PCC metrics.

Building on this insight, we integrate AEM regularization into the MIL framework to penalize excessive attention concentration.

WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing. This approach bridges multimodal research and clinical feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

However, multimodal frameworks often entangle these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressing discriminative features. To address this, we propose Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables.

However, their massive size and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module (FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams. Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiCo: Multiple Instance Learning with Context-Aware Clustering for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18028v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Genome-Anchored Foundation Model Embeddings Improve Molecular Prediction from Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19681v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision oncology requires accurate molecular insights, yet obtaining these directly from genomics is costly and time-consuming for broad clinical use. Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover, PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs. By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations, PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for wider clinical application.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[HistoART: Histopathology Artifact Detection and Reporting Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00044v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however, other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis, it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach (KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds, out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]), outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978]) and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted for oral presentation at Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism. Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image (WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future advancements in multimodal clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MIDL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.</p></details> | Submitted to TMLR |
| **[Cross-Modality Learning for Predicting IHC Biomarkers from H&E-Stained Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15853v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI: 0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Based Quality Control of Histopathology Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03289v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We developed a software pipeline for quality control (QC) of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) that segments various regions, such as blurs of different levels, tissue regions, tissue folds, and pen marks. Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

The growing adoption of digital pathology only intensifies the need for an intermediary digital slide format that emphasizes performance for use between slide servers and image management software. The DICOM standard is a well-established format widely used for the long-term storage of both images and associated critical metadata. However, it was inherently designed for radiology rather than digital pathology, a discipline that imposes a unique set of performance requirements due to high-speed multi-pyramidal rendering within whole slide viewer applications. Here we introduce the Iris file extension, a binary container specification explicitly designed for performance-oriented whole slide image viewer systems. The Iris file extension specification is explicit and straightforward, adding modern compression support, a dynamic structure with fully optional metadata features, computationally trivial deep file validation, corruption recovery capabilities, and slide annotations. In addition to the file specification document, we provide source code to allow for (de)serialization and validation of a binary stream against the standard. We also provide corresponding binary builds with C++, Python, and JavaScript language support. Finally, we provide full encoder and decoder implementation source code, as well as binary builds (part of the separate Iris Codec Community module), with language bindings for C++ and Python, allowing for easy integration with existing WSI solutions. We provide the Iris File Extension specification openly to the community in the form of a Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative 4.0 International license.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

Artifacts have been shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis. Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation. We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues. From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together (chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.</p></details> |  |

Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility, especially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring efficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.</p></details> |  |

However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models.

However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT. Our models are open-source and compatible with popular tools for data annotation. We also provide scripts for whole-slide image segmentation. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/patho-sam.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in MIDL 2025</p></details> |
| **[DLiPath: A Benchmark for the Comprehensive Assessment of Donor Liver Based on Histopathological Image Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03185v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research.

| **[The Butterfly Effect in Pathology: Exploring Security in Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24141v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore, we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Jiashuai-Liu-hmos/Attack-WSI-pathology-foundation-models.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

First, we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI) to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores, achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&E-stained WSIs of breast cancer.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages, 9 Figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Mutual Knowledge Distillation in Bi-Directional Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12074v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[PathBench: A comprehensive comparison benchmark for pathology foundation models towards precision oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20202v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |

While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which achieves a theoretically bounded approximation of full self-attention while delivering practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07999v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables + Supplementary materials Preprint is pre-peer review version.

| **[Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Linearity: Squeeze-and-Recalibrate Blocks for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15504v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters and no architectural changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04045v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14783v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12711v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Quality Evaluation of Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images Based on Content Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13875v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS) diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in terms of speed and consistency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions.

| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Pathology Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy in pathology image analysis. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490K samples from diverse pathology tasks, we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Continual Learning for Whole Slide Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10649v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions, preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data. A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs, and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNCAF: A GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework for Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Semantic Segmentation in WSI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08430v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized clusters of immune cells, whose maturity and area can be quantified in whole slide image (WSI) for various prognostic tasks. Existing methods for assessing these characteristics typically rely on cell proxy tasks and require additional post-processing steps. In this work, We focus on a novel task-TLS Semantic Segmentation (TLS-SS)-which segments both the regions and maturation stages of TLS in WSI in an end-to-end manner. Due to the extensive scale of WSI and patch-based segmentation strategies, TLS-SS necessitates integrating from neighboring patches to guide target patch (target) segmentation. Previous techniques often employ on multi-resolution approaches, constraining the capacity to leverage the broader neighboring context while tend to preserve coarse-grained information. To address this, we propose a GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework (GNCAF), which progressively aggregates multi-hop neighboring context from the target and employs a self-attention mechanism to guide the segmentation of the target. GNCAF can be integrated with various segmentation models to enhance their ability to perceive contextual information outside of the patch. We build two TLS-SS datasets, called TCGA-COAD and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former (comprising 225 WSIs and 5041 TLSs) publicly available. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNCAF, achieving a maximum of 22.08% and 26.57% improvement in mF1 and mIoU, respectively. Additionally, we also validate the task scalability of GNCAF on segmentation of lymph node metastases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Similarity Proportion Loss for Classifying Skeletal Muscle Recovery Stages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04150v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental analysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover mechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional approach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging and expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological information of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with automated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a quantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully labeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a weakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However, current LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature extractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing recovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the loss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale Learning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion loss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor by using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our model with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in classification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI2024 workshop ADSMI in Morocco (oral) [Peer-reviewed]</p></details> |

The identification and segmentation of these lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics, necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset (ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the field.</p></details> |  |

Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis</p></details> |  |

However, the black-box nature of these models often limits their clinical adoption. We introduce GRAPHITE (Graph-based Interpretable Tissue Examination), a post-hoc explainable framework designed for breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. GRAPHITE employs a multiscale approach, extracting patches at various magnification levels, constructing an hierarchical graph, and utilising graph attention networks (GAT) with scalewise attention (SAN) to capture scale-dependent features. We trained the model on 140 tumour TMA cores and four benign whole slide images from which 140 benign samples were created, and tested it on 53 pathologist-annotated TMA samples. GRAPHITE outperformed traditional XAI methods, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.56, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, and a threshold robustness (ThR) of 0.70, indicating that the model maintains high performance across a wide range of thresholds. In clinical utility, GRAPHITE achieved the highest area under the decision curve (AUDC) of 4.17e+5, indicating reliable decision support across thresholds. These results highlight GRAPHITE's potential as a clinically valuable tool in computational pathology, providing interpretable visualisations that align with the pathologists' diagnostic reasoning and support precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 Pa...</summary><p>25 Pages, 10 Figures, 1 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Lifelong Whole Slide Image Analysis: Online Vision-Language Adaptation and Past-to-Present Gradient Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01984v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> | IEEE Access (2025) |
| **[Self-Supervision Enhances Instance-based Multiple Instance Learning Methods in Digital Pathology: A Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01109v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as the best solution for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging (SPIE)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we analyze why attention-based methods tend to rely on spurious correlations in their predictions. Furthermore, we revisit max-pooling-based approaches and examine the reasons behind the underperformance of existing methods. We argue that well-trained max-pooling-based MIL models can make predictions based on causal factors and avoid relying on spurious correlations. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective max-pooling-based MIL method (FocusMIL) that outperforms existing mainstream attention-based methods on two datasets. In this position paper, we advocate renewed attention to max-pooling-based methods to achieve more robust and interpretable predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Resolution Pathology-Language Pre-training Model with Text-Guided Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18856v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification, tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization across different resolutions. Pre-trained on a comprehensive TCGA dataset with 34 million image-language pairs at various resolutions, our fine-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts across multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in CPath.

| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

| **[Iris: A Next Generation Digital Pathology Rendering Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15437v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. Our source code and experimental results will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, conference submission</p></details> |

However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel lightweight graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation mechanism replacing traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a high margin in terms of balanced accuracy, while being significantly smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers, is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters, and can generalize when using features from different backbones. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology.

Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs), high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology (TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It selects representative patches from each identified group based on an uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially, this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016. Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset, outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in advancing the field of digital pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, 42 references</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Semi-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification by Two-level Cross Consistency Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12132v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical pathological diagnosis. It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.</p></details> |  |

The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |

In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate the performance of several Deep Learning (DL) methods for cell detection in Papanicolaou-stained cytological Whole Slide Images (WSIs), focusing on accuracy of predictions and computational efficiency. We examine recentoff-the-shelf algorithms as well as custom-designed detectors, applying them to two datasets: the CNSeg Dataset and the Oral Cancer (OC) Dataset. Our comparison includes well-established segmentation methods such as StarDist, Cellpose, and the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), alongside centroid-based Fully Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) approaches.

We also explore the impact of dataset size and data augmentation techniques on model performance. Results show that centroid-based methods, particularly the Improved Fully Convolutional Regression Network (IFCRN) method, outperform segmentation-based methods in terms of both detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model. First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks. Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform. Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model. Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality. The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48. By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes. Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution, we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics, including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels. Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate translation towards routine use by pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[CORE - A Cell-Level Coarse-to-Fine Image Registration Engine for Multi-stain Image Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03826v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  |

However, spatial, semantic, and decision entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling. Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent decision-making process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/Prince-Lee-PathAI/PG-CIDL</p></details> |

Comprehensive datasets that combine histopathological images with genetic and survival data across various tumour sites are essential for advancing computational pathology and personalised medicine. We present SurGen, a dataset comprising 1,020 H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) from 843 colorectal cancer cases. The dataset includes detailed annotations for key genetic mutations (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) and mismatch repair status, as well as survival data for 426 cases. We illustrate SurGen's utility with a proof-of-concept model that predicts mismatch repair status directly from WSIs, achieving a test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8273. These preliminary results underscore the dataset's potential to facilitate research in biomarker discovery, prognostic modelling, and advanced machine learning applications in colorectal cancer and beyond. SurGen offers a valuable resource for the scientific community, enabling studies that require high-quality WSIs linked with comprehensive clinical and genetic information on colorectal cancer. Our initial findings affirm the dataset's capacity to advance diagnostic precision and foster the development of personalised treatment strategies in colorectal oncology.

| **[STARC-9: A Large-scale Dataset for Multi-Class Tissue Classification for CRC Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00383v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-class tissue-type classification of colorectal cancer (CRC) histopathologic images is a significant step in the development of downstream machine learning models for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, existing public CRC datasets often lack morphologic diversity, suffer from class imbalance, and contain low-quality image tiles, limiting model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford coloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue classification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image tiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000 tiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++, designed to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an encoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors from tiles within each whole-slide image. Then, K-means clustering groups morphologically similar tiles, followed by equal-frequency binning to sample diverse morphologic patterns within each class. The selected tiles are subsequently verified by expert gastrointestinal pathologists to ensure accuracy. This semi-automated process significantly reduces manual effort while producing high-quality, diverse tiles. To evaluate STARC-9, we benchmarked convolutional neural networks, transformers, and pathology-specific foundation models on multi-class CRC tissue classification and segmentation tasks, showing superior generalizability compared to models trained on existing datasets. Although we demonstrate the utility of DeepCluster++ on CRC as a pilot use-case, it is a flexible framework that can be used for constructing high-quality datasets from large WSI repositories across a wide range of cancer and non-cancer applications.</p></details> | 37 pages, 18 figures |

These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Heterogeneous Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27237v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs. However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both pathologists and AI systems that might support human experts.

These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.</p></details> | 52 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Accurate and Scalable Multimodal Pathology Retrieval via Attentive Vision-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23224v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, static hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) file servers cannot natively stream subregions of high-resolution image files, such as the IFE. The majority of contemporary WSI viewer systems are designed as browser-based web applications and leverage OpenSeaDragon as the tile-based rendering framework. These systems convert WSI files to Deep Zoom Images (DZI) for compatibility with simple static HTTP file servers. To address this limitation, we have developed the Iris RESTful Server, a low-overhead HTTP server with a RESTful API that is natively compatible with the DICOMweb WADO-RS API. Written in C++ with Boost Beast HTTP and Asio networking libraries atop the public IFE libraries, the server offers both security and high performance. Testing shows that a single Raspberry Pi equivalent system can handle a peak of 5,061 req/s (average 3,883 req/s) with a median latency of 21 ms on a private (i.e. hospital) network. We also developed and merged a new OpenSeaDragon TileSource, compatible with the Iris RESTful API, into the next OpenSeaDragon release, enabling simple and immediate drop-in replacement of DZI images within WSI viewer stacks. Designed as a secure cross-origin resource sharing microservice, this architecture includes detailed deployment instructions for new or existing WSI workflows, and the public examples.restful.irisdigitalpathology.org subdomain is provided as a development tool to accelerate WSI web viewer development.

This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17982v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

We built a pipeline to apply previously validated segmentation models of kidney structures and extract quantitative features from these structures. Such quantitative analysis also requires qualitative inspection of results for quality control, exploration, and communication. We extend the Vitessce web-based visualization tool to enable visualization of segmentations of multiple types of functional tissue units, such as, glomeruli, tubules, arteries/arterioles in the kidney. Moreover, we propose a standard representation for files containing multiple segmentation bitmasks, which we define polymorphically, such that existing formats including OME-TIFF, OME-NGFF, AnnData, MuData, and SpatialData can be used. We demonstrate that these methods enable researchers and the broader public to interactively explore datasets containing multiple segmented entities and associated features, including for exploration of renal morphometry of biopsies from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flow Model with Low-Rank Transformers for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21829v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete modalities scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we assume for each instance a random location. Then, conditional on this random location, we assume for the feature vector a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed SGMM allows the mixing probability to be nonparametrically related to the spatial location. Compared with a classical GMM, SGMM is considerably more flexible and allows the instances from the same class to be spatially clustered. To estimate the SGMM, novel EM algorithms are developed and rigorous asymptotic theories are established. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate our finite sample performance. For a real application, we apply our SGMM method to the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images (WSIs) for breast cancer detection. The SGMM method demonstrates outstanding clustering performance.</p></details> |  |

However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights.

The recent advancement of foundation models in computational pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%; HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens, replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between treatments.</p></details> |  |

Our method integrating four key components. Firstly, to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly, we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$ and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method across diverse cancer types.</p></details> |  |

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |

Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2025)</p></details> |

We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06113v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications.

| **[A Hierarchical Geometry-guided Transformer for Histological Subtyping of Primary Liver Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05657v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, accepted by IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |

While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientMIL: Efficient Linear-Complexity MIL Method for WSI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23640v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.</p></details> | Submitted to Array |
| **[Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.</p></details> |  |

However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse.

| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic and Visual Crop-Guided Diffusion Models for Heterogeneous Tissue Synthesis in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17847v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</p></details> |  |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm where one cancer corresponds to one model. However, it naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot utilize the knowledge of other cancers. Although a multi-task learning-like framework has been studied recently, it usually has high demands on computational resources and needs considerable costs in iterative training on ultra-large multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper makes a paradigm shift to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It has three major parts: (i) we curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors); (ii) beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmark, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of transferability; (iii) we further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. We hope CROPKT could serve as an inception and lay the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025. Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[IPGPhormer: Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer for Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12381v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[ME-Mamba: Multi-Expert Mamba with Efficient Knowledge Capture and Fusion for Multimodal Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16900v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer research. Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with >92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang9/Rasa.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCORPION: Addressing Scanner-Induced Variability in Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20907v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UNSURE 2025 workshop in MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Cluster-Level Sparse Multi-Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11034v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering, within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones. This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles. Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).</p></details> | 12 pages,5 figures |
| **[OCELOT 2023: Cell Detection from Cell-Tissue Interaction Challenge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09153v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses. However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted manuscript of an article published in Medical Image Analysis (Elsevier).

However, existing open-source tools are often distributed as source code or Docker containers, requiring advanced programming skills that hinder accessibility for non-programmers, such as clinicians. Additionally, current models are typically trained on a single dataset and lack flexibility in adjusting confidence levels for predictions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GloFinder, a QuPath plugin designed for single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs with online editing through the graphical user interface (GUI). GloFinder employs CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework utilizing circle representations for precise object localization, with models trained on approximately 160,000 manually annotated glomeruli. To further enhance accuracy, the plugin incorporates Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), an ensemble method that combines confidence scores from multiple CircleNet models to produce refined predictions, achieving superior performance in glomerular detection. GloFinder enables direct visualization and editing of results in QuPath, facilitating seamless interaction for clinicians and providing a powerful tool for nephropathology research and clinical practice.

| **[MSCPT: Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification with Multi-scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11505v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for the weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Hanminghao/MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TMI for possible publication</p></details> |

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing content generation models in computational pathology.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures.

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable and Loosely-Coupled Multimodal Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03408v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records, and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities, making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.</p></details> |  |
| **[MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia, chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima. Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</p></details> |  |

The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

These images can be viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science. When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects. We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs. Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes. We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.</p></details> |  |

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted precision oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/lilab-stanford/ELF)</p></details> |

However, pathology images from different hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features, posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Pathology Co-pilot via Reasoning Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17303v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[HistoViT: Vision Transformer for Accurate and Scalable Histopathological Cancer Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11181v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 Figures |

A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations.

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance.

Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms.

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation (AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16 dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times.

However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.</p></details> |  |

LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain.

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

| **[Welcome New Doctor: Continual Learning with Expert Consultation and Autoregressive Inference for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02220v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Mamba for Efficient Whole Slide Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17457v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Conventional patch-based methods inevitably distort spatial relationships or treat patches as independent samples, while traditional attention mechanisms, designed for dense, uniformly distributed data, are computationally impractical for WSIs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse-native computational framework that preserves exact spatial relationships, unlocking advanced modeling techniques and bridging a long-standing gap between WSI analysis and general vision. Based on this framework, we develop Sparse Pyramid Attention Networks (SPAN), incorporating a hierarchical sparse pyramid attention architecture with shifted windows that efficiently directs computational resources to informative regions. SPAN comprises two key modules: Spatial-Adaptive Feature Condensation, which progressively builds multi-scale representations from a single-scale input through sparse downsampling, and Context-Aware Feature Refinement, which captures long-range dependencies via shifted windows and global tokens. Evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate SPAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating both our framework's effectiveness and SPAN's specific advantages in capturing contextual and hierachical representations that existing methods fundamentally cannot model. Our work establishes a new paradigm for WSI analysis that overcomes long-standing computational barriers. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We developed methods to predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists' attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Medical Image Analysis (MEDIA), Elsevier, 2025.

| **[Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[$MV_{Hybrid}$: Improving Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction with Hybrid State Space-Vision Transformer Backbone in Pathology Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00383v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745). Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas. Approaches included regularised Cox regression (n=4), classical ML (n=13), and deep learning (n=31). Reported c-indices ranged 0.550-0.857; multimodal models typically outperformed unimodal ones. However, all studies showed unclear/high bias, limited external validation, and little focus on clinical utility.

Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, a critical limitation of current MIL methods lies in the underutilization of pre-training for the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches initialize the aggregator randomly and train it from scratch, making performance highly sensitive to the quantity of labeled WSIs and ignoring the abundance of unlabeled WSIs commonly available in clinical settings. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating PreMix as a plug-in module into HIPT yields an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training sizes and datasets. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i) multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides, with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection, and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides.

Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |

SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text, 2 page references, 2 page appendix; under submission</p></details> |

While recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models. Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces DepViT-CAD, a deployable AI system for multi-class cancer diagnosis in histopathology. At its core is MAViT, a novel Multi-Attention Vision Transformer designed to capture fine-grained morphological patterns across diverse tumor types. MAViT was trained on expert-annotated patches from 1008 whole-slide images, covering 11 diagnostic categories, including 10 major cancers and non-tumor tissue. DepViT-CAD was validated on two independent cohorts: 275 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 50 routine clinical cases from pathology labs, achieving diagnostic sensitivities of 94.11% and 92%, respectively. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architecture with large-scale real-world validation, DepViT-CAD offers a robust and scalable approach for AI-assisted cancer diagnostics.

| **[Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08178v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/MIL-JigsawPuzzles.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20653v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</p></details> | preprint |

Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing.</p></details> |  |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05077v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Automatic Data Curation for Vision Foundation Models in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18709v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02395v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance. To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD) module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF) strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in survival prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLa: Hierarchical Vision-Language Collaboration for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04613v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language (VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment. Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation (CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving over 20% in PCC metrics.

WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |

To enable survival prediction using only whole-slide images (WSI), we propose the Visual-Genomic Answering-Guided Transformer (VGAT), a framework integrating Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques for genomic modality reconstruction. By adapting VQA's text feature extraction approach, we derive stable genomic representations that circumvent dimensionality challenges in raw genomic data. Simultaneously, a cluster-based visual prompt module selectively enhances discriminative WSI patches, addressing noise from unfiltered image regions. Evaluated across five TCGA datasets, VGAT outperforms existing WSI-only methods, demonstrating the viability of genomic-informed inference without sequencing.

However, multimodal frameworks often entangle these representations, limiting interpretability and potentially suppressing discriminative features. To address this, we propose Disentangled and Interpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that separates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based fusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared representations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote disentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive explanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We evaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative average improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved performance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the underlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables.

However, their massive size and the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial challenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream Attention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework that combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL explicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic consistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding instance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables efficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module (FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further introduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams. Experiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior discriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[MiCo: Multiple Instance Learning with Context-Aware Clustering for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18028v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

Predicting complex molecular features and patient prognosis directly from routine whole-slide images (WSI) remains a major challenge for current deep learning methods. Here we introduce PathLUPI, which uses transcriptomic privileged information during training to extract genome-anchored histological embeddings, enabling effective molecular prediction using only WSIs at inference. Through extensive evaluation across 49 molecular oncology tasks using 11,257 cases among 20 cohorts, PathLUPI demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional methods trained solely on WSIs. Crucially, it achieves AUC $\geq$ 0.80 in 14 of the biomarker prediction and molecular subtyping tasks and C-index $\geq$ 0.70 in survival cohorts of 5 major cancer types. Moreover, PathLUPI embeddings reveal distinct cellular morphological signatures associated with specific genotypes and related biological pathways within WSIs. By effectively encoding molecular context to refine WSI representations, PathLUPI overcomes a key limitation of existing models and offers a novel strategy to bridge molecular insights with routine pathology workflows for wider clinical application.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[HistoART: Histopathology Artifact Detection and Reporting Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00044v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however, other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis, it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach (KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds, out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]), outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978]) and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted for oral presentation at Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) 2025</p></details> |

To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism. Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image (WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual relevance and generation quality. Evaluated on the HistGen benchmark, the framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future advancements in multimodal clinical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MIDL 2025</p></details> |
| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.</p></details> | Submitted to TMLR |
| **[Cross-Modality Learning for Predicting IHC Biomarkers from H&E-Stained Whole-Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15853v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is a cornerstone of pathological analysis, offering reliable visualization of cellular morphology and tissue architecture for cancer diagnosis, subtyping, and grading. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining provides molecular insights by detecting specific proteins within tissues, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and improving treatment planning. However, IHC staining is costly, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring specialized expertise. To address these limitations, this study proposes HistoStainAlign, a novel deep learning framework that predicts IHC staining patterns directly from H&E whole-slide images (WSIs) by learning joint representations of morphological and molecular features. The framework integrates paired H&E and IHC embeddings through a contrastive training strategy, capturing complementary features across staining modalities without patch-level annotations or tissue registration. The model was evaluated on gastrointestinal and lung tissue WSIs with three commonly used IHC stains: P53, PD-L1, and Ki-67. HistoStainAlign achieved weighted F1 scores of 0.735 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.670-0.799], 0.830 [95% CI: 0.772-0.886], and 0.723 [95% CI: 0.607-0.836], respectively for these three IHC stains. Embedding analyses demonstrated the robustness of the contrastive alignment in capturing meaningful cross-stain relationships. Comparisons with a baseline model further highlight the advantage of incorporating contrastive learning for improved stain pattern prediction. This study demonstrates the potential of computational approaches to serve as a pre-screening tool, helping prioritize cases for IHC staining and improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In the context of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges, including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is available at FedWSIDD.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Based Quality Control of Histopathology Whole Slide Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03289v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We developed a software pipeline for quality control (QC) of histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) that segments various regions, such as blurs of different levels, tissue regions, tissue folds, and pen marks. Given the necessity and increasing availability of GPUs for processing WSIs, the proposed pipeline comprises multiple lightweight deep learning models to strike a balance between accuracy and speed. The pipeline was evaluated in all TCGAs, which is the largest publicly available WSI dataset containing more than 11,000 histopathological images from 28 organs. It was compared to a previous work, which was not based on deep learning, and it showed consistent improvement in segmentation results across organs. To minimize annotation effort for tissue and blur segmentation, annotated images were automatically prepared by mosaicking patches (sub-images) from various WSIs whose labels were identified using a patch classification tool HistoROI. Due to the generality of our trained QC pipeline and its extensive testing the potential impact of this work is broad. It can be used for automated pre-processing any WSI cohort to enhance the accuracy and reliability of large-scale histopathology image analysis for both research and clinical use. We have made the trained models, training scripts, training data, and inference results publicly available at https://github.com/abhijeetptl5/wsisegqc, which should enable the research community to use the pipeline right out of the box or further customize it to new datasets and applications in the future.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[The Iris File Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10009v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A modern digital pathology vendor-agnostic binary slide format specifically targeting the unmet need of efficient real-time transfer and display has not yet been established. The growing adoption of digital pathology only intensifies the need for an intermediary digital slide format that emphasizes performance for use between slide servers and image management software. The DICOM standard is a well-established format widely used for the long-term storage of both images and associated critical metadata. However, it was inherently designed for radiology rather than digital pathology, a discipline that imposes a unique set of performance requirements due to high-speed multi-pyramidal rendering within whole slide viewer applications. Here we introduce the Iris file extension, a binary container specification explicitly designed for performance-oriented whole slide image viewer systems. The Iris file extension specification is explicit and straightforward, adding modern compression support, a dynamic structure with fully optional metadata features, computationally trivial deep file validation, corruption recovery capabilities, and slide annotations. In addition to the file specification document, we provide source code to allow for (de)serialization and validation of a binary stream against the standard. We also provide corresponding binary builds with C++, Python, and JavaScript language support. Finally, we provide full encoder and decoder implementation source code, as well as binary builds (part of the separate Iris Codec Community module), with language bindings for C++ and Python, allowing for easy integration with existing WSI solutions. We provide the Iris File Extension specification openly to the community in the form of a Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative 4.0 International license.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Semi-Automated Quality Assurance in Digital Pathology: Tile Classification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10916v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology, where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis. Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation. We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues. From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together (chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.</p></details> |  |

Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Contrastive self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address unique problems in pathology that involve synthesizing images; overcoming annotated data scarcity, enabling privacy-preserving data sharing, and performing inherently generative tasks, such as virtual staining. We introduce PixCell, the first diffusion-based generative foundation model for histopathology. We train PixCell on PanCan-30M, a vast, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H\&E-stained whole slide images covering various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any annotated data. PixCell generates diverse and high-quality images across multiple cancer types, which we find can be used in place of real data to train a self-supervised discriminative model. Synthetic images shared between institutions are subject to fewer regulatory barriers than would be the case with real clinical images. Furthermore, we showcase the ability to precisely control image generation using a small set of annotated images, which can be used for both data augmentation and educational purposes. Testing on a cell segmentation task, a mask-guided PixCell enables targeted data augmentation, improving downstream performance. Finally, we demonstrate PixCell's ability to use H\&E structural staining to infer results from molecular marker studies; we use this capability to infer IHC staining from H\&E images. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Computation- and Communication-efficient Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02628v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance across a wide range of applications, current computational pathology models face significant diagnostic efficiency challenges due to their reliance on high-magnification whole-slide image analysis. This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility, especially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring efficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.</p></details> |  |

However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models.

However, methods for automatic segmentation often struggle with new data from a different distribution, requiring users to manually annotate nuclei and retrain data-specific models. Vision foundation models (VFMs), such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offer a more robust alternative for automatic and interactive segmentation. Despite their success in natural images, a foundation model for nucleus segmentation in histopathology is still missing. Initial efforts to adapt SAM have shown some success, but did not yet introduce a comprehensive model for diverse segmentation tasks. To close this gap, we introduce PathoSAM, a VFM for nucleus segmentation, based on training SAM on a diverse dataset. Our extensive experiments show that it is the new state-of-the-art model for automatic and interactive nucleus instance segmentation in histopathology. We also demonstrate how it can be adapted for other segmentation tasks, including semantic nucleus segmentation. For this task, we show that it yields results better than popular methods, while not yet beating the state-of-the-art, CellViT.

| **[DLiPath: A Benchmark for the Comprehensive Assessment of Donor Liver Based on Histopathological Image Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03185v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research.

| **[The Butterfly Effect in Pathology: Exploring Security in Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24141v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore, we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Jiashuai-Liu-hmos/Attack-WSI-pathology-foundation-models.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

First, we trained a pixel classifier to segment tumor, tumor-associated stroma, and other tissue compartments in breast cancer H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI) to isolate tumor-associated stroma for subsequent analysis. Next, we applied a pre-trained StarDist deep learning model in QuPath for cell detection and used the extracted cell features to train a binary classifier distinguishing TILs from other cells. To evaluate our TILs assessment pipeline, we calculated the TIL density in each WSI and categorized them as low, medium, or high TIL levels. Our pipeline was evaluated against pathologist-assigned TIL scores, achieving a Cohen's kappa of 0.71 on the external test set, corroborating previous research findings. These results confirm that existing software can offer a practical solution for the assessment of TILs in H&E-stained WSIs of breast cancer.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 Pa...</summary><p>16 Pages, 9 Figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Denoising Mutual Knowledge Distillation in Bi-Directional Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12074v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[PathBench: A comprehensive comparison benchmark for pathology foundation models towards precision oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20202v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |

While transformer architectures excel at modeling long-range correlations through self-attention, their quadratic computational complexity makes them impractical for computational pathology applications. Existing solutions like local-global or linear self-attention reduce computational costs but compromise the strong modeling capabilities of full self-attention. In this work, we propose Querent, i.e., the query-aware long contextual dynamic modeling framework, which achieves a theoretically bounded approximation of full self-attention while delivering practical efficiency. Our method adaptively predicts which surrounding regions are most relevant for each patch, enabling focused yet unrestricted attention computation only with potentially important contexts. By using efficient region-wise metadata computation and importance estimation, our approach dramatically reduces computational overhead while preserving global perception to model fine-grained patch correlations. Through comprehensive experiments on biomarker prediction, gene mutation prediction, cancer subtyping, and survival analysis across over 10 WSI datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07999v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables + Supplementary materials Preprint is pre-peer review version.

| **[Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Linearity: Squeeze-and-Recalibrate Blocks for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15504v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters and no architectural changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04045v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14783v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |
| **[Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12711v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Quality Evaluation of Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images Based on Content Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13875v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS) diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in terms of speed and consistency.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |

Despite advances in treatment, the underlying genetic mechanisms driving this aggressiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed multimodal deep learning approaches to investigate glioblastoma heterogeneity using joint image/RNA-seq analysis. Our results reveal novel genes associated with glioblastoma. By leveraging a combination of whole-slide images and RNA-seq, as well as introducing novel methods to encode RNA-seq data, we identified specific genetic profiles that may explain different patterns of glioblastoma progression. These findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying glioblastoma heterogeneity and highlight potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions.

| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Pathology Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy in pathology image analysis. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490K samples from diverse pathology tasks, we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Multiple Instance Learning with Continual Learning for Whole Slide Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10649v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in medical imaging and deep learning have propelled progress in whole slide image (WSI) analysis, with multiple instance learning (MIL) showing promise for efficient and accurate diagnostics. However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions, preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data. A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs, and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[GNCAF: A GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework for Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Semantic Segmentation in WSI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08430v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized clusters of immune cells, whose maturity and area can be quantified in whole slide image (WSI) for various prognostic tasks. Existing methods for assessing these characteristics typically rely on cell proxy tasks and require additional post-processing steps. In this work, We focus on a novel task-TLS Semantic Segmentation (TLS-SS)-which segments both the regions and maturation stages of TLS in WSI in an end-to-end manner. Due to the extensive scale of WSI and patch-based segmentation strategies, TLS-SS necessitates integrating from neighboring patches to guide target patch (target) segmentation. Previous techniques often employ on multi-resolution approaches, constraining the capacity to leverage the broader neighboring context while tend to preserve coarse-grained information. To address this, we propose a GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework (GNCAF), which progressively aggregates multi-hop neighboring context from the target and employs a self-attention mechanism to guide the segmentation of the target. GNCAF can be integrated with various segmentation models to enhance their ability to perceive contextual information outside of the patch. We build two TLS-SS datasets, called TCGA-COAD and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former (comprising 225 WSIs and 5041 TLSs) publicly available. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNCAF, achieving a maximum of 22.08% and 26.57% improvement in mF1 and mIoU, respectively. Additionally, we also validate the task scalability of GNCAF on segmentation of lymph node metastases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Similarity Proportion Loss for Classifying Skeletal Muscle Recovery Stages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04150v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the regeneration process of damaged muscle tissue is a fundamental analysis in muscle research to measure experimental effect sizes and uncover mechanisms behind muscle weakness due to aging and disease. The conventional approach to assessing muscle tissue regeneration involves whole-slide imaging and expert visual inspection of the recovery stages based on the morphological information of cells and fibers. There is a need to replace these tasks with automated methods incorporating machine learning techniques to ensure a quantitative and objective analysis. Given the limited availability of fully labeled data, a possible approach is Learning from Label Proportions (LLP), a weakly supervised learning method using class label proportions. However, current LLP methods have two limitations: (1) they cannot adapt the feature extractor for muscle tissues, and (2) they treat the classes representing recovery stages and cell morphological changes as nominal, resulting in the loss of ordinal information. To address these issues, we propose Ordinal Scale Learning from Similarity Proportion (OSLSP), which uses a similarity proportion loss derived from two bag combinations. OSLSP can update the feature extractor by using class proportion attention to the ordinal scale of the class. Our model with OSLSP outperforms large-scale pre-trained and fine-tuning models in classification tasks of skeletal muscle recovery stages.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI2024 workshop ADSMI in Morocco (oral) [Peer-reviewed]</p></details> |

The identification and segmentation of these lesions are crucial for understanding AD progression but remain challenging due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets and the impact of staining variations on automated image analysis. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for pathology image segmentation; however, model performance is significantly influenced by variations in staining characteristics, necessitating effective stain normalization and enhancement techniques. In this study, we address these challenges by introducing an open-source dataset (ADNP-15) of neuritic plaques (i.e., amyloid deposits combined with a crown of dystrophic tau-positive neurites) in human brain whole slide images. We establish a comprehensive benchmark by evaluating five widely adopted deep learning models across four stain normalization techniques, providing deeper insights into their influence on neuritic plaque segmentation. Additionally, we propose a novel image enhancement method that improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in complex tissue structures, by enhancing structural details and mitigating staining inconsistencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that this enhancement strategy significantly boosts model generalization and segmentation accuracy. All datasets and code are open-source, ensuring transparency and reproducibility while enabling further advancements in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13754v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly.

| **[Beyond the Monitor: Mixed Reality Visualization and AI for Enhanced Digital Pathology Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02780v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis</p></details> |  |

However, the black-box nature of these models often limits their clinical adoption. We introduce GRAPHITE (Graph-based Interpretable Tissue Examination), a post-hoc explainable framework designed for breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA) analysis. GRAPHITE employs a multiscale approach, extracting patches at various magnification levels, constructing an hierarchical graph, and utilising graph attention networks (GAT) with scalewise attention (SAN) to capture scale-dependent features. We trained the model on 140 tumour TMA cores and four benign whole slide images from which 140 benign samples were created, and tested it on 53 pathologist-annotated TMA samples. GRAPHITE outperformed traditional XAI methods, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.56, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94, and a threshold robustness (ThR) of 0.70, indicating that the model maintains high performance across a wide range of thresholds. In clinical utility, GRAPHITE achieved the highest area under the decision curve (AUDC) of 4.17e+5, indicating reliable decision support across thresholds. These results highlight GRAPHITE's potential as a clinically valuable tool in computational pathology, providing interpretable visualisations that align with the pathologists' diagnostic reasoning and support precision medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 Pa...</summary><p>25 Pages, 10 Figures, 1 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Lifelong Whole Slide Image Analysis: Online Vision-Language Adaptation and Past-to-Present Gradient Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01984v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in accurate cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as they provide tissue details at the cellular level. However, the rapid growth of computational tasks involving WSIs poses significant challenges. Given that WSIs are gigapixels in size, they present difficulties in terms of storage, processing, and model training. Therefore, it is essential to develop lifelong learning approaches for WSI analysis. In scenarios where slides are distributed across multiple institutes, we aim to leverage them to develop a unified online model as a computational tool for cancer diagnosis in clinical and hospital settings. In this study, we introduce ADaFGrad, a method designed to enhance lifelong learning for whole-slide image (WSI) analysis. First, we leverage pathology vision-language foundation models to develop a framework that enables interaction between a slide's regional tissue features and a predefined text-based prototype buffer. Additionally, we propose a gradient-distillation mechanism that mimics the gradient of a logit with respect to the classification-head parameters across past and current iterations in a continual-learning setting. We construct a sequence of six TCGA datasets for training and evaluation. Experimental results show that ADaFGrad outperforms both state-of-the-art WSI-specific and conventional continual-learning methods after only a few training epochs, exceeding them by up to +5.068% in the class-incremental learning scenario while exhibiting the least forgetting (i.e., retaining the most knowledge from previous tasks). Moreover, ADaFGrad surpasses its baseline by as much as +40.084% in accuracy, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed modules.</p></details> | IEEE Access (2025) |
| **[Self-Supervision Enhances Instance-based Multiple Instance Learning Methods in Digital Pathology: A Benchmark Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01109v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as the best solution for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging (SPIE)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we analyze why attention-based methods tend to rely on spurious correlations in their predictions. Furthermore, we revisit max-pooling-based approaches and examine the reasons behind the underperformance of existing methods. We argue that well-trained max-pooling-based MIL models can make predictions based on causal factors and avoid relying on spurious correlations. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective max-pooling-based MIL method (FocusMIL) that outperforms existing mainstream attention-based methods on two datasets. In this position paper, we advocate renewed attention to max-pooling-based methods to achieve more robust and interpretable predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Resolution Pathology-Language Pre-training Model with Text-Guided Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18856v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification, tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization across different resolutions. Pre-trained on a comprehensive TCGA dataset with 34 million image-language pairs at various resolutions, our fine-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts across multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in CPath.

| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

| **[Iris: A Next Generation Digital Pathology Rendering Engine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15437v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology is a tool of rapidly evolving importance within the discipline of pathology. Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. Our source code and experimental results will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, conference submission</p></details> |

However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel lightweight graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation mechanism replacing traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a high margin in terms of balanced accuracy, while being significantly smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers, is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters, and can generalize when using features from different backbones. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology.

Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports. Our proposed model can understand pan-cancer WSIs and clinical context from various cancer types. We argue that our proposed model has the potential to assist clinicians by comprehensively understanding complex morphology of WSIs for cancer diagnosis through the integration of multiple modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[TUMLS: Trustful Fully Unsupervised Multi-Level Segmentation for Whole Slide Images of Histology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12718v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology, augmented by artificial intelligence (AI), holds significant promise for improving the workflow of pathologists. However, challenges such as the labor-intensive annotation of whole slide images (WSIs), high computational demands, and trust concerns arising from the absence of uncertainty estimation in predictions hinder the practical application of current AI methodologies in histopathology. To address these issues, we present a novel trustful fully unsupervised multi-level segmentation methodology (TUMLS) for WSIs. TUMLS adopts an autoencoder (AE) as a feature extractor to identify the different tissue types within low-resolution training data. It selects representative patches from each identified group based on an uncertainty measure and then does unsupervised nuclei segmentation in their respective higher-resolution space without using any ML algorithms. Crucially, this solution integrates seamlessly into clinicians workflows, transforming the examination of a whole WSI into a review of concise, interpretable cross-level insights. This integration significantly enhances and accelerates the workflow while ensuring transparency. We evaluated our approach using the UPENN-GBM dataset, where the AE achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0016. Additionally, nucleus segmentation is assessed on the MoNuSeg dataset, outperforming all unsupervised approaches with an F1 score of 77.46% and a Jaccard score of 63.35%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of TUMLS in advancing the field of digital pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables, 42 references</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Semi-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification by Two-level Cross Consistency Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12132v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical pathological diagnosis. It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.</p></details> |  |

The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |

While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised model called DomainGCN that employs a graph convolution neural network (GCN) and incorporates domain-specific knowledge of ulcer features, specifically, the presence of epithelium, lymphocytes, and debris for WSI-level ulcer prediction in IBD.

In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.</p></details> |  |

We evaluate the performance of several Deep Learning (DL) methods for cell detection in Papanicolaou-stained cytological Whole Slide Images (WSIs), focusing on accuracy of predictions and computational efficiency. We examine recentoff-the-shelf algorithms as well as custom-designed detectors, applying them to two datasets: the CNSeg Dataset and the Oral Cancer (OC) Dataset. Our comparison includes well-established segmentation methods such as StarDist, Cellpose, and the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), alongside centroid-based Fully Convolutional Regression Network (FCRN) approaches. We introduce a suitable evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of predictions based on the distance from ground truth positions. We also explore the impact of dataset size and data augmentation techniques on model performance. Results show that centroid-based methods, particularly the Improved Fully Convolutional Regression Network (IFCRN) method, outperform segmentation-based methods in terms of both detection accuracy and computational efficiency. This study highlights the potential of centroid-based detectors as a preferred option for cell detection in resource-limited environments, offering faster processing times and lower GPU memory usage without compromising accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures, SCIA2025</p></details> |

To address these issues, we propose a solution that enhances data quality, model performance, and usability by creating a lightweight, extensible cell segmentation and classification model. First, we update data labels through cross-relabeling to refine annotations of PanNuke and MoNuSAC, producing a unified dataset with seven distinct cell types. Second, we leverage the H-Optimus foundation model as a fixed encoder to improve feature representation for simultaneous segmentation and classification tasks. Third, to address foundation models' computational demands, we distill knowledge to reduce model size and complexity while maintaining comparable performance. Finally, we integrate the distilled model into QuPath, a widely used open-source digital pathology platform. Results demonstrate improved segmentation and classification performance using the H-Optimus-based model compared to a CNN-based model. Specifically, average $R^2$ improved from 0.575 to 0.871, and average $PQ$ score improved from 0.450 to 0.492, indicating better alignment with actual cell counts and enhanced segmentation quality. The distilled model maintains comparable performance while reducing parameter count by a factor of 48. By reducing computational complexity and integrating into workflows, this approach may significantly impact diagnostics, reduce pathologist workload, and improve outcomes. Although the method shows promise, extensive validation is necessary prior to clinical deployment.</p></details> | 30 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Toward Clinically Grounded Foundation Models in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Evaluation of Preprocessing Techniques for Accurate Image Registration in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04171v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method, which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values (AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures |

While recent studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures, whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5% (CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can support their effective development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 5th Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium</p></details> |
| **[PLUTO-4: Frontier Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02826v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks. Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer (PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains. Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks, including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Elicitation with Large Language Models for Interpretable Cancer Stage Identification from Pathology Reports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01052v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer staging is critical for patient prognosis and treatment planning, yet extracting pathologic TNM staging from unstructured pathology reports poses a persistent challenge. Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG), employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited annotated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM2: Unlocking Multi-Modal General Pathology AI with Clinical Dialogue](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13063v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rapid progress in the field of computational pathology has been enabled by foundation models. These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fusion of Heterogeneous Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27237v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs. However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[CPathAgent: An Agent-based Foundation Model for Interpretable High-Resolution Pathology Image Analysis Mimicking Pathologists' Diagnostic Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20510v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.</p></details> | 52 pages, 34 figures |

Existing anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP. By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization, outperforming competing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[Accurate and Scalable Multimodal Pathology Retrieval via Attentive Vision-Language Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23224v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Multi-branch ConvNeXt Architecture for Identifying Subtle Pathological Features in CT Scans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09107v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features. This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source Code : https://github.com/Irash-Perera/MedNeXt-Branch</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting End-to-End Learning with Slide-level Supervision in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02408v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area.

| **[Inverse Optimal Control of Muscle Force Sharing During Pathological Gait](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17456v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides, possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.</p></details> |  |

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIRROR: Multi-Modal Pathological Self-Supervised Representation Learning via Modality Alignment and Retention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00374v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 10 tables.

| **[Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.</p></details> | 38 Pages, 8 Figures |

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning.

| **[G2L:From Giga-Scale to Cancer-Specific Large-Scale Pathology Foundation Models via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11176v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.</p></details> |  |

While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This study developed and validated the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9 items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426). Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered (network analysis) approaches revealed a 5-10% prevalence rate, a symptom network structure similar to IGD, and predictive factors related to psychological distress and functional impairment. These findings indicate that PUGenAI shares features of the emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD rather than the competence-based type. These results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while avoiding over-pathologizing.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 10\% compared to base models.

Prior work often relies on domain fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3 dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks, YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of 23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting and benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal and precision oncology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20475v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations. We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the PIPPI Workshop of MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streamline pathology foundation model by cross-magnification distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23097v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |

While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4% "Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathoHR: Hierarchical Reasoning for Vision-Language Models in Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06105v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |

By leveraging TNM staging guidelines and pathology reports, we build comprehensive pathological concepts for kidney cancer. Then, we extract deep features from whole slide images using foundation models, construct pathological graphs to capture spatial correlations, and trained graph neural networks to identify these concepts. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in kidney cancer survival analysis, highlighting its explainability and fairness in identifying low- and high-risk patients.

| **[SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20952v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025. Copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) Descriptor to Characterize Imaging Heterogeneity in Confounding Tumor Pathologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19258v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</p></details> |  |

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

However, echocardiographic data for certain pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies. Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator, allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity. Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers. Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively.

To address this, we frame pathology detection as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pretraining, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our fully self-supervised model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Furthermore, in a supervised fine-tuning setting, Screener surpasses existing self-supervised pretraining methods, establishing it as a state-of-the-art foundation for pathology segmentation. The code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Accurate differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. In addition, we incorporated ConvNeXt V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to complement PFMs. During training, we employed a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving competitive balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces an uncertainty-aware framework for chest X-ray diagnosis based on a DenseNet-121 backbone, enhanced with two selective prediction mechanisms: entropy-based rejection and confidence interval-based rejection. Both methods enable the model to abstain from uncertain predictions, improving reliability by deferring ambiguous cases to clinical experts. A quantile-based calibration procedure is employed to tune rejection thresholds using either global or class-specific strategies. Experiments conducted on three large public datasets (PadChest, NIH ChestX-ray14, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that selective rejection improves the trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and coverage, with entropy-based rejection yielding the highest average AUC across all pathologies. These results support the integration of selective prediction into AI-assisted diagnostic workflows, providing a practical step toward safer, uncertainty-aware deployment of deep learning in clinical settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors, introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.</p></details> | 6 Tables, 11 Figures |

| **[AURAD: Anatomy-Pathology Unified Radiology Synthesis with Progressive Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04819v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings. However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity, controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code, pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems.

This issue is critical in the medical domain, where text-conditioned generated medical images could enable insurance fraud or falsified records, highlighting the urgent need for reliable safeguards against unethical use. While watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution in general image domains, their direct application to medical imaging presents significant challenges. A key challenge is preserving fine-grained disease manifestations, as even minor distortions from a watermark may lead to clinical misinterpretation, which compromises diagnostic integrity. To overcome this gap, we present MedSign, a deep learning-based watermarking framework specifically designed for text-to-medical image synthesis, which preserves pathologically significant regions by adaptively adjusting watermark strength. Specifically, we generate a pathology localization map using cross-attention between medical text tokens and the diffusion denoising network, aggregating token-wise attention across layers, heads, and time steps. Leveraging this map, we optimize the LDM decoder to incorporate watermarking during image synthesis, ensuring cohesive integration while minimizing interference in diagnostically critical regions. Experimental results show that our MedSign preserves diagnostic integrity while ensuring watermark robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image quality and detection accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and OIA-ODIR datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01071v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |

The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Are the Majority of Public Computational Notebooks Pathologically Non-Executable?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04184v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks are the de facto platforms for exploratory data science, offering an interactive programming environment where users can create, modify, and execute code cells in any sequence. However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |

To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives, these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.</p></details> |  |

Multiple instance learning (MIL) remains an essential next step following foundation model, designing a framework to aggregate patch-level features into slide-level predictions. We present EAGLE-Net, a structure-preserving, attention-guided MIL architecture designed to augment prediction and interpretability. EAGLE-Net integrates multi-scale absolute spatial encoding to capture global tissue architecture, a top-K neighborhood-aware loss to focus attention on local microenvironments, and background suppression loss to minimize false positives. We benchmarked EAGLE-Net on large pan-cancer datasets, including three cancer types for classification (10,260 slides) and seven cancer types for survival prediction (4,172 slides), using three distinct histology foundation backbones (REMEDIES, Uni-V1, Uni2-h). Across tasks, EAGLE-Net achieved up to 3% higher classification accuracy and the top concordance indices in 6 of 7 cancer types, producing smooth, biologically coherent attention maps that aligned with expert annotations and highlighted invasive fronts, necrosis, and immune infiltration. These results position EAGLE-Net as a generalizable, interpretable framework that complements foundation models, enabling improved biomarker discovery, prognostic modeling, and clinical decision support</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 7 main Figures, 8 Extended Data Figures</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Prototype Alignment for Semi-supervised Pathology Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19574v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly due to ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization (e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely on perturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficult to capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complex pathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel segmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a multimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of MPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes and pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing supervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine supervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on unlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into segmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary modeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture (TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained foundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of pathology-relevant features. Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND, EBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, validating its dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[CellEcoNet: Decoding the Cellular Language of Pathology with Deep Learning for Invasive Lung Adenocarcinoma Recurrence Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16742v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA) patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Implications of Automatic Anonymization in Pathological Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00409v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. We present a comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality across groups (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners showed a non-significant trend toward higher original speech ratings (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference was minimal after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic metrics; intelligibility was linked to perceived quality in original speech but not after anonymization. These findings underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder-specific anonymization strategies that preserve both privacy and perceptual integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology, where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL) foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited. Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features, overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics. We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.</p></details> |  |

While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process, facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Although classical post-processing techniques such as watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows.

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |

Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba), SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation.

However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg, the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 21 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making.

While MRI offers detailed visualization of cervical spine anatomy, manual interpretation remains labor-intensive and prone to error. To address this, we developed an innovative AI-assisted Expert-based Diagnosis System that automates both segmentation and diagnosis of cervical spondylosis using MRI. Leveraging multi-center datasets of cervical MRI images from patients with cervical spondylosis, our system features a pathology-guided segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting key cervical anatomical structures. The segmentation is followed by an expert-based diagnostic framework that automates the calculation of critical clinical indicators. Our segmentation model achieved an impressive average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.90 across four cervical spinal anatomies and demonstrated enhanced accuracy in herniation areas. Diagnostic evaluation further showcased the system's precision, with the lowest mean average errors (MAE) for the C2-C7 Cobb angle and the Maximum Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC) coefficient. In addition, our method delivered high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in herniation localization, K-line status assessment, T2 hyperintensity detection, and Kang grading. Comparative analysis and external validation demonstrate that our system outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark for segmentation and diagnostic tasks for cervical spondylosis.</p></details> |  |

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision.

Traditional methods like laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice pathologies using phonation data. Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents, further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |

While computer vision models have shown potential for objectively evaluating parkinsonian gait, their effectiveness is limited by scarce clinical datasets and the challenge of collecting large and well-labelled data, impacting model accuracy and risk of bias. To address these gaps, we propose GAITGen, a novel framework that generates realistic gait sequences conditioned on specified pathology severity levels. GAITGen employs a Conditional Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder to learn disentangled representations of motion dynamics and pathology-specific factors, coupled with Mask and Residual Transformers for conditioned sequence generation. GAITGen generates realistic, diverse gait sequences across severity levels, enriching datasets and enabling large-scale model training in parkinsonian gait analysis. Experiments on our new PD-GaM (real) dataset demonstrate that GAITGen outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models in both reconstruction fidelity and generation quality, accurately capturing critical pathology-specific gait features. A clinical user study confirms the realism and clinical relevance of our generated sequences. Moreover, incorporating GAITGen-generated data into downstream tasks improves parkinsonian gait severity estimation, highlighting its potential for advancing clinical gait analysis.</p></details> |  |

Current pathology domain adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing both computational and annotation costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

These factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases, limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search, enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the Patho-AgenticRAG repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-AgenticRAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRASPing Anatomy to Improve Pathology Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03374v1)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates anatomical context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 16th MICCAI Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI2025)</p></details> |

We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC), with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice pathology classification while reducing gender bias through hierarchical modeling of vocal characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[$MV_{Hybrid}$: Improving Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction with Hybrid State Space-Vision Transformer Backbone in Pathology Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00383v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

However, existing approaches for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios. Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with multiple symptoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for oral presentation by The 2nd MICCAI Student Board (MSB) EMERGE Workshop</p></details> |

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology Foundation Models are Scanner Sensitive: Benchmark and Mitigation with Contrastive ScanGen Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22092v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) has shown great potential in mining actionable insights from Whole Slide Images (WSIs). Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |
| **[VLM-CPL: Consensus Pseudo Labels from Vision-Language Models for Annotation-Free Pathological Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15836v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of pathological images is the basis for automatic cancer diagnosis. Despite that deep learning methods have achieved remarkable performance, they heavily rely on labeled data, demanding extensive human annotation efforts. In this study, we present a novel human annotation-free method by leveraging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Without human annotation, pseudo-labels of the training set are obtained by utilizing the zero-shot inference capabilities of VLM, which may contain a lot of noise due to the domain gap between the pre-training and target datasets. To address this issue, we introduce VLM-CPL, a novel approach that contains two noisy label filtering techniques with a semi-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, we first obtain prompt-based pseudo-labels with uncertainty estimation by zero-shot inference with the VLM using multiple augmented views of an input. Then, by leveraging the feature representation ability of VLM, we obtain feature-based pseudo-labels via sample clustering in the feature space. Prompt-feature consensus is introduced to select reliable samples based on the consensus between the two types of pseudo-labels. We further propose High-confidence Cross Supervision by to learn from samples with reliable pseudo-labels and the remaining unlabeled samples. Additionally, we present an innovative open-set prompting strategy that filters irrelevant patches from whole slides to enhance the quality of selected patches. Experimental results on five public pathological image datasets for patch-level and slide-level classification showed that our method substantially outperformed zero-shot classification by VLMs, and was superior to existing noisy label learning methods.

Existing methods often struggle to maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features, frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform.

Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of 0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases. Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated, to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values and highlight our model's overall predictive power.

However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.</p></details> |  |

However, existing deep learning models heavily rely on expert annotations and lack generalization capabilities in open clinical environments. In this study, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc lies in its extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts from reports with abundant image features, to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies and unseen pathologies without the reliance on image annotations from experts. We conducted primary experiments on a dataset of 220K pairs of image-report chest X-ray images, and performed extensive validation across 8 external datasets encompassing 34 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both annotation-free localization and classification tasks. Additionally, we assessed the generalizability of AFLoc on other modalities, including histopathology and retinal fundus images. Extensive experiments show that AFLoc exhibits robust generalization capabilities, even surpassing human benchmarks in localizing five different types of pathological images. These results highlight the potential of AFLoc in reducing annotation requirements and its applicability in complex clinical environments.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming. In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved histological fidelity. This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual staining technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures.

In parallel, spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains \textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496 patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from 2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients. It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance of 85\%.

| **[CineMyoPS: Segmenting Myocardial Pathologies from Cine Cardiac MR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02289v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful, acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically, CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss (resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning. Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

Their ability to leverage prior knowledge from massive datasets has streamlined the development of intelligent pathology models. However, we identify several critical and interrelated ethical risks that remain underexplored, yet must be addressed to enable the safe translation of PFMs from lab to clinic. These include the potential leakage of patient-sensitive attributes, disparities in model performance across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the reliance on diagnosis-irrelevant features that undermine clinical reliability. In this study, we pioneer the quantitative analysis for ethical risks in PFMs, including privacy leakage, clinical reliability, and group fairness. Specifically, we propose an evaluation framework that systematically measures key dimensions of ethical concern: the degree to which patient-sensitive attributes can be inferred from model representations, the extent of performance disparities across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the influence of diagnostically irrelevant features on model decisions. We further investigate the underlying causes of these ethical risks in PFMs and empirically validate our findings. Then we offer insights into potential directions for mitigating such risks, aiming to inform the development of more ethically robust PFMs. This work provides the first quantitative and systematic evaluation of ethical risks in PFMs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for ethical safeguards in PFMs and offer actionable insights for building more trustworthy and clinically robust PFMs. To facilitate future research and deployment, we will release the assessment framework as an online toolkit to support the development, auditing, and deployment of ethically robust PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages,5 figure,23 tables</p></details> |
| **[OpenPath: Open-Set Active Learning for Pathology Image Classification via Pre-trained Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15318v3)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology image classification plays a crucial role in accurate medical diagnosis and treatment planning. Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Medical Document Analysis: Enhancing Trustworthy Pathology and Differential Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19702v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks. Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence. Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable, explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions, representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis for real-world healthcare applications.

In digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images, such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over 20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for digital pathology images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

| **[StainPIDR: A Pathological Image Decouplingand Reconstruction Method for Stain Normalization Based on Color Vector Quantization and Structure Restaining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17879v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices. Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color (decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17734v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathCoT: Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Zero-shot Pathology Visual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01029v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors, leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual understanding and reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, pathology still remains a more challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists. In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we propose Patho-CLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both Patho-CLIP and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project is available at the Patho-R1 repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-R1.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods apply computer vision models directly to medical tasks, neglecting the distinct characteristics of pathological images. This mismatch often leads to computational inefficiencies, particularly in edge-computing scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Network Similarity Directed Initialization (NSDI) strategy to improve the stability of neural architecture search (NAS). Furthermore, we introduce domain adaptation into one-shot NAS to better handle variations in staining and semantic scale across pathology datasets. Experiments on the BRACS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, delivering both superior classification performance and clinically relevant feature localization.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 Pa...</summary><p>45 Pages, 22 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just 1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for future research and application in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Automated Quality Assurance in Digital Pathology: Tile Classification Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10916v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology, where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis. Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation. We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues. From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together (chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 tables and 6 figures</p></details> |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |

However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility, especially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring efficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Butterfly Effect in Pathology: Exploring Security in Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24141v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore, we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Jiashuai-Liu-hmos/Attack-WSI-pathology-foundation-models.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose PathFL, a novel multi-alignment Federated Learning framework for pathology image segmentation that addresses these challenges through three-level alignment strategies of image, feature, and model aggregation. Firstly, at the image level, a collaborative style enhancement module aligns and diversifies local data by facilitating style information exchange across clients. Secondly, at the feature level, an adaptive feature alignment module ensures implicit alignment in the representation space by infusing local features with global insights, promoting consistency across heterogeneous client features learning. Finally, at the model aggregation level, a stratified similarity aggregation strategy hierarchically aligns and aggregates models on the server, using layer-specific similarity to account for client discrepancies and enhance global generalization. Comprehensive evaluations on four sets of heterogeneous pathology image datasets, encompassing cross-source, cross-modality, cross-organ, and cross-scanner variations, validate the effectiveness of our PathFL in achieving better performance and robustness against data heterogeneity.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures; Accepted by MedIA</p></details> |
| **[PathBench: A comprehensive comparison benchmark for pathology foundation models towards precision oncology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20202v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of pathology foundation models has revolutionized computational histopathology, enabling highly accurate, generalized whole-slide image analysis for improved cancer diagnosis, and prognosis assessment. While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |

This work introduces MVP (Multi-source Voice Pathology detection), a novel approach that leverages transformers operating directly on raw voice signals. We explore three fusion strategies to combine sentence reading and sustained vowel recordings: waveform concatenation, intermediate feature fusion, and decision-level combination. Empirical validation across the German, Portuguese, and Italian languages shows that intermediate feature fusion using transformers best captures the complementary characteristics of both recording types. Our approach achieves up to +13% AUC improvement over single-source methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Interspeech 2025</p></details> |

However, building reliable normality models requires vast healthy datasets, as hospitals' data is inherently biased toward symptomatic populations, while privacy regulations hinder the assembly of representative healthy cohorts. To address this limitation, we propose PathoSCOPE, a few-shot unsupervised pathology detection framework that requires only a small set of non-pathological samples (minimum 2 shots), significantly improving data efficiency. We introduce Global-Local Contrastive Loss (GLCL), comprised of a Local Contrastive Loss to reduce the variability of non-pathological embeddings and a Global Contrastive Loss to enhance the discrimination of pathological regions. We also propose a Pathology-informed Embedding Generation (PiEG) module that synthesizes pathological embeddings guided by the global loss, better exploiting the limited non-pathological samples. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 and ChestXray8 datasets, PathoSCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency (2.48 GFLOPs, 166 FPS).</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07999v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables + Supplementary materials Preprint is pre-peer review version.

| **[Discovering Pathology Rationale and Token Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Pathology Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15687v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches. One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales, directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection. Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04045v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12711v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmentation of temporomandibular joint structures on mri images using neural networks for diagnosis of pathologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12963v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), in particular, for the segmentation of the articular disc on MRI images. The relevance of the work is due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study, the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result, are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from 94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ pathologies.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions.

| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Pathology Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy in pathology image analysis. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490K samples from diverse pathology tasks, we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimMIL: A Universal Weakly Supervised Pre-Training Framework for Multi-Instance Learning in Whole Slide Pathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06710v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various multi-instance learning (MIL) based approaches have been developed and successfully applied to whole-slide pathological images (WSI). Existing MIL methods emphasize the importance of feature aggregators, but largely neglect the instance-level representation learning. They assume that the availability of a pre-trained feature extractor can be directly utilized or fine-tuned, which is not always the case. This paper proposes to pre-train feature extractor for MIL via a weakly-supervised scheme, i.e., propagating the weak bag-level labels to the corresponding instances for supervised learning. To learn effective features for MIL, we further delve into several key components, including strong data augmentation, a non-linear prediction head and the robust loss function. We conduct experiments on common large-scale WSI datasets and find it achieves better performance than other pre-training schemes (e.g., ImageNet pre-training and self-supervised learning) in different downstream tasks. We further show the compatibility and scalability of the proposed scheme by deploying it in fine-tuning the pathological-specific models and pre-training on merged multiple datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on the representation learning for MIL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13754v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis</p></details> |  |

It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging (SPIE)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeDSLIP: Medical Dual-Stream Language-Image Pre-training with Pathology-Anatomy Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10635v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology and anatomy are two essential groups of semantics in medical data. Pathology describes what the diseases are, while anatomy explains where the diseases occur. They describe diseases from different perspectives, providing complementary insights into diseases. Thus, properly understanding these semantics and their relationships can enhance medical vision-language models (VLMs). However, pathology and anatomy semantics are usually entangled in medical data, hindering VLMs from explicitly modeling these semantics and their relationships. To address this challenge, we propose MeDSLIP, a novel Medical Dual-Stream Language-Image Pre-training pipeline, to disentangle pathology and anatomy semantics and model the relationships between them. We introduce a dual-stream mechanism in MeDSLIP to explicitly disentangle medical semantics into pathology-relevant and anatomy-relevant streams and align visual and textual information within each stream. Furthermore, we propose an interaction modeling module with prototypical contrastive learning loss and intra-image contrastive learning loss to regularize the relationships between pathology and anatomy semantics. We apply MeDSLIP to chest X-ray analysis and conduct comprehensive evaluations with four benchmark datasets: NIH CXR14, RSNA Pneumonia, SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax, and COVIDx CXR-4. The results demonstrate MeDSLIP's superior generalizability and transferability across different scenarios.

| **[Multi-Resolution Pathology-Language Pre-training Model with Text-Guided Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18856v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification, tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization across different resolutions.

| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

However, spectral bias in neural networks impedes modeling high-frequency deformations, producing inaccurate, biomechanically implausible results, particularly in pathological data. This paper addresses spectral bias in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by integrating Fourier Feature mappings and introducing modulation strategies into a PINN framework. Experiments on two distinct datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods enhance the PINN's ability to capture complex, high-frequency deformations in cardiomyopathies, achieving superior registration accuracy while maintaining biomechanical plausibility - thus providing a foundation for scalable cardiac image registration and generalization across multiple patients and pathologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs. Our source code and experimental results will be available soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, conference submission</p></details> |

Traditional multimodal models typically emphasize outcomes over the reasoning process, compromising the reliability of clinical decisions. To address the weak reasoning abilities and lack of supervised processes in pathological VLMs, we have innovatively proposed PathVLM-R1, a visual language model designed specifically for pathological images. We have based our model on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and enhanced its performance for pathological tasks through meticulously designed post-training strategies. Firstly, we conduct supervised fine-tuning guided by pathological data to imbue the model with foundational pathological knowledge, forming a new pathological base model. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and propose a dual reward-driven reinforcement learning optimization, ensuring strict constraint on logical supervision of the reasoning process and accuracy of results via cross-modal process reward and outcome accuracy reward. In the pathological image question-answering tasks, the testing results of PathVLM-R1 demonstrate a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods, and it demonstrated superior performance compared to the Qwen2.5-VL-32B version despite having a significantly smaller parameter size. Furthermore, in out-domain data evaluation involving four medical imaging modalities: Computed Tomography (CT), dermoscopy, fundus photography, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images: PathVLM-R1's transfer performance improved by an average of 17.3% compared to traditional SFT methods. These results clearly indicate that PathVLM-R1 not only enhances accuracy but also possesses broad applicability and expansion potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathological Cases for a Class of Reachability-Based Garbage Collectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11654v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although existing garbage collectors (GCs) perform extremely well on typical programs, there still exist pathological programs for which modern GCs significantly degrade performance. This observation begs the question: might there exist a 'holy grail' GC algorithm, as yet undiscovered, guaranteeing both constant-length pause times and that memory is collected promptly upon becoming unreachable? For decades, researchers have understood that such a GC is not always possible, i.e., some pathological behavior is unavoidable when the program can make heap cycles and operates near the memory limit, regardless of the GC algorithm used. However, this understanding has until now been only informal, lacking a rigorous formal proof. This paper complements that informal understanding with a rigorous proof, showing with mathematical certainty that every GC that can implement a realistic mutator-observer interface has some pathological program that forces it to either introduce a long GC pause into program execution or reject an allocation even though there is available space. Hence, language designers must either accept these pathological scenarios and design heuristic approaches that minimize their impact (e.g., generational collection), or restrict programs and environments to a strict subset of the behaviors allowed by our mutator-observer-style interface (e.g., by enforcing a type system that disallows cycles or overprovisioning memory).</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion for Digital Pathology: Achieving Foundation Model Performance with Minimal Clinical Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12351v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in digital pathology use massive datasets to learn useful compact feature representations of complex histology images. However, there is limited transparency into what drives the correlation between dataset size and performance, raising the question of whether simply adding more data to increase performance is always necessary. In this study, we propose a prototype-guided diffusion model to generate high-fidelity synthetic pathology data at scale, enabling large-scale self-supervised learning and reducing reliance on real patient samples while preserving downstream performance. Using guidance from histological prototypes during sampling, our approach ensures biologically and diagnostically meaningful variations in the generated data. We demonstrate that self-supervised features trained on our synthetic dataset achieve competitive performance despite using ~60x-760x less data than models trained on large real-world datasets. Notably, models trained using our synthetic data showed statistically comparable or better performance across multiple evaluation metrics and tasks, even when compared to models trained on orders of magnitude larger datasets. Our hybrid approach, combining synthetic and real data, further enhanced performance, achieving top results in several evaluations. These findings underscore the potential of generative AI to create compelling training data for digital pathology, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive clinical datasets and highlighting the efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards contrast- and pathology-agnostic clinical fetal brain MRI segmentation using SynthSeg](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10244v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a crucial role in fetal neurodevelopmental research. Structural annotations of MR images are an important step for quantitative analysis of the developing human brain, with Deep learning providing an automated alternative for this otherwise tedious manual process. However, segmentation performances of Convolutional Neural Networks often suffer from domain shift, where the network fails when applied to subjects that deviate from the distribution with which it is trained on. In this work, we aim to train networks capable of automatically segmenting fetal brain MRIs with a wide range of domain shifts pertaining to differences in subject physiology and acquisition environments, in particular shape-based differences commonly observed in pathological cases. We introduce a novel data-driven train-time sampling strategy that seeks to fully exploit the diversity of a given training dataset to enhance the domain generalizability of the trained networks. We adapted our sampler, together with other existing data augmentation techniques, to the SynthSeg framework, a generator that utilizes domain randomization to generate diverse training data, and ran thorough experimentations and ablation studies on a wide range of training/testing data to test the validity of the approaches. Our networks achieved notable improvements in the segmentation quality on testing subjects with intense anatomical abnormalities (p < 1e-4), though at the cost of a slighter decrease in performance in cases with fewer abnormalities. Our work also lays the foundation for future works on creating and adapting data-driven sampling strategies for other training pipelines.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Towards A Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model via Unified Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pretrained on large-scale datasets are revolutionizing the field of computational pathology (CPath). The generalization ability of foundation models is crucial for the success in various downstream clinical tasks. However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability and overall performance unclear. To address this gap, we established a most comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks, including slide-level classification, survival prediction, ROI-tissue classification, ROI retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self-knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self-distillation to enable image representation learning via local-global alignment. Based on this framework, we curated a dataset of 96,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and developed a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). This advanced model was trained on a substantial dataset comprising 190 million images extracted from approximately 72,000 publicly available slides, encompassing 34 major tissue types. Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an impressive average rank of 1.6, with 42 tasks ranked 1st, while the second-best model, UNI, attains an average rank of 3.7, with only 6 tasks ranked 1st.</p></details> | update |

We present PathSeqSAM, a novel approach that treats 2D pathology slices as sequential video frames using SAM2's memory mechanisms. Our method introduces a distance-aware attention mechanism that accounts for variable physical distances between slices and employs LoRA for domain adaptation. Evaluated on the KPI Challenge 2024 dataset for glomeruli segmentation, PathSeqSAM demonstrates improved segmentation quality, particularly in challenging cases that benefit from cross-slice context.

There has been an increasing interest in computational approaches that can predict gene expression directly from digitalized histopathology images. While image foundation models have shown promise in a variety of pathology downstream analysis, their performances on gene-expression prediction are still limited. Explicitly incorporating information from the transcriptomic models can help image models to address domain shift, yet the fine-tuning and alignment of foundation models can be expensive. In the work, we propose Parameter Efficient Knowledge trAnsfer (PEKA), a novel framework that leverages Block-Affine Adaptation and integrates knowledge distillation and structure alignment losses for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We evaluated PEKA for gene expression prediction using multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets (comprising 206,123 image tiles with matched gene expression profiles) that encompassed various types of tissue. PEKA achieved at least 5\% performance improvement over baseline foundation models while also outperforming alternative parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. We will release the code, datasets and aligned models after peer-review to facilitate broader adoption and further development for parameter efficient model alignment.</p></details> |  |

The common approach for training a segmentation model relies on a pre-trained feature extractor and a dataset of paired image and mask annotations. These are used to train a lightweight prediction model that translates features into per-pixel classes. The choice of the feature extractor is central to the performance of the final segmentation model, and recent literature has focused on finding tasks to pre-train the feature extractor. In this paper, we propose PathSegDiff, a novel approach for histopathology image segmentation that leverages Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) as pre-trained featured extractors. Our method utilizes a pathology-specific LDM, guided by a self-supervised encoder, to extract rich semantic information from H\&E stained histopathology images. We employ a simple, fully convolutional network to process the features extracted from the LDM and generate segmentation masks. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods on the BCSS and GlaS datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of domain-specific diffusion pre-training in capturing intricate tissue structures and enhancing segmentation accuracy in histopathology images.</p></details> |  |

Automated segmentation of kidney pathology images plays a central role in facilitating clinical workflows, yet conventional segmentation models often require delicate threshold tuning. This paper proposes a novel \textit{Cascaded Threshold-Integrated U-Net (CTI-Unet)} to overcome the limitations of single-threshold segmentation. By sequentially integrating multiple thresholded outputs, our approach can reconcile noise suppression with the preservation of finer structural details. Experiments on the challenging KPIs2024 dataset demonstrate that CTI-Unet outperforms state-of-the-art architectures such as nnU-Net, Swin-Unet, and CE-Net, offering a robust and flexible framework for kidney pathology image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a systematic evaluation of transfer learning strategies for brain tumor classification using these models. We analyzed 254 cases comprising five major tumor types: glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and metastatic tumors. Comparing state-of-the-art foundation models with conventional approaches, we found that foundation models demonstrated robust classification performance with as few as 10 patches per case, despite the traditional assumption that extensive per-case image sampling is necessary. Furthermore, our evaluation revealed that simple transfer learning strategies like linear probing were sufficient, while fine-tuning often degraded model performance. These findings suggest a paradigm shift from "training encoders on extensive pathological data" to "querying pre-trained encoders with labeled datasets", providing practical implications for implementing AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical pathology.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Recent studies demonstrate that increasing the training data set and model size and integrating domain-specific image processing techniques can significantly enhance the model's performance on downstream tasks. Building on these insights, our work incorporates several recent modifications to the standard DINOv2 framework from the literature to optimize the training of pathology FMs. We also apply a post-training procedure for fine-tuning models on higher-resolution images to further enrich the information encoded in the embeddings. We present three novel pathology FMs trained on up to two orders of magnitude fewer WSIs than those used to train other state-of-the-art FMs while demonstrating a comparable or superior performance on downstream tasks. Even the model trained on TCGA alone (12k WSIs) outperforms most existing FMs and, on average, matches Virchow2, the second-best FM published to date. This suggests that there still remains a significant potential for further improving the models and algorithms used to train pathology FMs to take full advantage of the vast data collections.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, limited labeled data in pathological images restricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance Migration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate more varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and internuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration Module (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process of nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an Internuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear spatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above, IM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts and internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks. Evaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images generated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation performance. Code will be made public later.</p></details> |  |

However, the IHC staining process is both time-consuming and costly. To address these limitations, the application of deep learning models for direct translation of cost-effective Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images into IHC stained images has emerged as an efficient solution. Nevertheless, the conversion from H&E to IHC images presents significant challenges, primarily due to alignment discrepancies between image pairs and the inherent diversity in IHC staining style patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Style Distribution Constraint Feature Alignment Network (SCFANet), which incorporates two innovative modules: the Style Distribution Constrainer (SDC) and Feature Alignment Learning (FAL). The SDC ensures consistency between the generated and target images' style distributions while integrating cycle consistency loss to maintain structural consistency. To mitigate the complexity of direct image-to-image translation, the FAL module decomposes the end-to-end translation task into two subtasks: image reconstruction and feature alignment. Furthermore, we ensure pathological consistency between generated and target images by maintaining pathological pattern consistency and Optical Density (OD) uniformity. Extensive experiments conducted on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemical (BCI) dataset demonstrate that our SCFANet model outperforms existing methods, achieving precise transformation of H&E-stained images into their IHC-stained counterparts. The proposed approach not only addresses the technical challenges in H&E to IHC image translation but also provides a robust framework for accurate and efficient stain conversion in pathological analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose CLERIC, a novel deep learning-based image compression framework designed specifically for whole slide images (WSIs). CLERIC integrates a learnable lifting scheme and advanced convolutional techniques to enhance compression efficiency while preserving critical pathological details. Our framework employs a lifting-scheme transform in the analysis stage to decompose images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling more structured latent representations. These components are processed through parallel encoders incorporating Deformable Residual Blocks (DRB) and Recurrent Residual Blocks (R2B) to improve feature extraction and spatial adaptability. The synthesis stage applies an inverse lifting transform for effective image reconstruction, ensuring high-fidelity restoration of fine-grained tissue structures. We evaluate CLERIC on a digital pathology image dataset and compare its performance against state-of-the-art learned image compression (LIC) models. Experimental results demonstrate that CLERIC achieves superior rate-distortion (RD) performance, significantly reducing storage requirements while maintaining high diagnostic image quality. Our study highlights the potential of deep learning-based compression in digital pathology, facilitating efficient data management and long-term storage while ensuring seamless integration into clinical workflows and AI-assisted diagnostic systems.

While pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore, ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from 20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification, biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across 27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks, including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade tasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation underline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward more efficient and high-quality medical services.</p></details> |  |

Details of the segmentation algorithm are rarely reported, and there is a lack of studies investigating the downstream effects of a poor segmentation algorithm. Disregarding tissue detection quality could create a bottleneck for downstream performance and jeopardize patient safety if diagnostically relevant parts of the specimen are excluded from analysis in clinical applications. This study aims to determine whether performance of downstream tasks is sensitive to the tissue detection method, and to compare performance of classical and AI-based tissue detection. To this end, we trained an AI model for Gleason grading of prostate cancer in whole slide images (WSIs) using two different tissue detection algorithms: thresholding (classical) and UNet++ (AI). A total of 33,823 WSIs scanned on five digital pathology scanners were used to train the tissue detection AI model. The downstream Gleason grading algorithm was trained and tested using 70,524 WSIs from 13 clinical sites scanned on 13 different scanners. There was a decrease from 116 (0.43%) to 22 (0.08%) fully undetected tissue samples when switching from thresholding-based tissue detection to AI-based, suggesting an AI model may be more reliable than a classical model for avoiding total failures on slides with unusual appearance. On the slides where tissue could be detected by both algorithms, no significant difference in overall Gleason grading performance was observed. However, tissue detection dependent clinically significant variations in AI grading were observed in 3.5% of malignant slides, highlighting the importance of robust tissue detection for optimal clinical performance of diagnostic AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 tables, 3 figures, 1 supplementary figure</p></details> |

| **[Cross-Modal Prototype Allocation: Unsupervised Slide Representation Learning via Patch-Text Contrast in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20190v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of pathology foundation models (FMs), the representation learning of whole slide images (WSIs) attracts increasing attention. Existing studies develop high-quality patch feature extractors and employ carefully designed aggregation schemes to derive slide-level representations. However, mainstream weakly supervised slide representation learning methods, primarily based on multiple instance learning (MIL), are tailored to specific downstream tasks, which limits their generalizability. To address this issue, some studies explore unsupervised slide representation learning. However, these approaches focus solely on the visual modality of patches, neglecting the rich semantic information embedded in textual data. In this work, we propose ProAlign, a cross-modal unsupervised slide representation learning framework. Specifically, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive text for the prototype types present in a WSI, introducing patch-text contrast to construct initial prototype embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a parameter-free attention aggregation strategy that utilizes the similarity between patches and these prototypes to form unsupervised slide embeddings applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that ProAlign outperforms existing unsupervised frameworks and achieves performance comparable to some weakly supervised models.</p></details> | 11pages,3 figures |
| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages |

However, diagnostic models often face the challenge of forgetting previously learned data during incremental training on datasets from different sources. To address this issue, we propose a new framework PaGMIL to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in breast cancer WSI classification. Our framework introduces two key components into the common MIL model architecture. First, it leverages microscopic pathological prior to select more accurate and diverse representative patches for MIL. Secondly, it trains separate classification heads for each task and uses macroscopic pathological prior knowledge, treating the thumbnail as a prompt guide (PG) to select the appropriate classification head. We evaluate the continual learning performance of PaGMIL across several public breast cancer datasets. PaGMIL achieves a better balance between the performance of the current task and the retention of previous tasks, outperforming other continual learning methods. Our code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | ICASSP2025(Oral) |

To address this, we introduce ELM (Ensemble of Language Models), a novel ensemble-based approach leveraging both small language models (SLMs) and large language models (LLMs). ELM utilizes six fine-tuned SLMs, where three SLMs use the top part of the pathology report and three SLMs use the bottom part. This is done to maximize report coverage. ELM requires five-out-of-six agreement for a tumor group classification. Disagreements are arbitrated by an LLM with a carefully curated prompt. Our evaluation across nineteen tumor groups demonstrates ELM achieves an average precision and recall of 0.94, outperforming single-model and ensemble-without-LLM approaches. Deployed at the British Columbia Cancer Registry, ELM demonstrates how LLMs can be successfully applied in a PBCR setting to achieve state-of-the-art results and significantly enhance operational efficiencies, saving hundreds of person-hours annually.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathoHR: Breast Cancer Survival Prediction on High-Resolution Pathological Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17970v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breast cancer survival prediction in computational pathology presents a remarkable challenge due to tumor heterogeneity. For instance, different regions of the same tumor in the pathology image can show distinct morphological and molecular characteristics. This makes it difficult to extract representative features from whole slide images (WSIs) that truly reflect the tumor's aggressive potential and likely survival outcomes. In this paper, we present PathoHR, a novel pipeline for accurate breast cancer survival prediction that enhances any size of pathological images to enable more effective feature learning. Our approach entails (1) the incorporation of a plug-and-play high-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) to enhance patch-wise WSI representation, enabling more detailed and comprehensive feature extraction, (2) the systematic evaluation of multiple advanced similarity metrics for comparing WSI-extracted features, optimizing the representation learning process to better capture tumor characteristics, (3) the demonstration that smaller image patches enhanced follow the proposed pipeline can achieve equivalent or superior prediction accuracy compared to raw larger patches, while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental findings valid that PathoHR provides the potential way of integrating enhanced image resolution with optimized feature learning to advance computational pathology, offering a promising direction for more accurate and efficient breast cancer survival prediction.

| **[Cross-Species Data Integration for Enhanced Layer Segmentation in Kidney Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09278v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate delineation of the boundaries between the renal cortex and medulla is crucial for subsequent functional structural analysis and disease diagnosis. Training high-quality deep-learning models for layer segmentation relies on the availability of large amounts of annotated data. However, due to the patient's privacy of medical data and scarce clinical cases, constructing pathological datasets from clinical sources is relatively difficult and expensive. Moreover, using external natural image datasets introduces noise during the domain generalization process. Cross-species homologous data, such as mouse kidney data, which exhibits high structural and feature similarity to human kidneys, has the potential to enhance model performance on human datasets. In this study, we incorporated the collected private Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stained mouse kidney dataset into the human kidney dataset for joint training. The results showed that after introducing cross-species homologous data, the semantic segmentation models based on CNN and Transformer architectures achieved an average increase of 1.77% and 1.24% in mIoU, and 1.76% and 0.89% in Dice score for the human renal cortex and medulla datasets, respectively. This approach is also capable of enhancing the model's generalization ability. This indicates that cross-species homologous data, as a low-noise trainable data source, can help improve model performance under conditions of limited clinical samples.

| **[Multi-Modal Foundation Models for Computational Pathology: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09091v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images. While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideChat: A Large Vision-Language Assistant for Whole-Slide Pathology Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11761v3)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology, they remain limited by a predominant focus on patch-level analysis, missing essential contextual information at the whole-slide level. The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks. For example, it achieved an overall accuracy of 81.17% on SlideBench-VQA (TCGA), and 54.15% on SlideBench-VQA (BCNB).

Despite its significance, most researchers in this field primarily focus on the registration of normal tissue into normal tissue. The negative impact of focal tissue, such as the loss of spatial correspondence information and the abnormal distortion of tissue, are rarely considered. In this paper, we propose GIRNet, a novel unsupervised approach for pathological image registration by incorporating segmentation and inpainting through the principles of Generation, Inpainting, and Registration (GIR). The registration, segmentation, and inpainting modules are trained simultaneously in a co-learning manner so that the segmentation of the focal area and the registration of inpainted pairs can improve collaboratively. Overall, the registration of pathological images is achieved in a completely unsupervised learning framework. Experimental results on multiple datasets, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of T1 sequences, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. Our results show that our method can accurately achieve the registration of pathological images and identify lesions even in challenging imaging modalities. Our unsupervised approach offers a promising solution for the efficient and cost-effective registration of pathological images.

| **[Variational Autoencoder for Personalized Pathological Speech Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14036v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalizability of speech enhancement (SE) models across speaker conditions remains largely unexplored, despite its critical importance for broader applicability. This paper investigates the performance of the hybrid variational autoencoder (VAE)-non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model for SE, focusing primarily on its generalizability to pathological speakers with Parkinson's disease. We show that VAE models trained on large neurotypical datasets perform poorly on pathological speech. While fine-tuning these pre-trained models with pathological speech improves performance, a performance gap remains between neurotypical and pathological speakers. To address this gap, we propose using personalized SE models derived from fine-tuning pre-trained models with only a few seconds of clean data from each speaker. Our results demonstrate that personalized models considerably enhance performance for all speakers, achieving comparable results for both neurotypical and pathological speakers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EUSIPCO 2025</p></details> |

Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance. In the first strategy, we provide a detailed explanation of the queried pathology. In the second strategy, we fine-tune a cheap, weak learner to achieve high performance on a specific metric, and textually provide its judgment to the MLVLM. Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27. We also demonstrate that our prompting strategies can be extended to general LVLM domains. Based on POPE metrics, it effectively suppresses the false negative predictions of existing LVLMs and improves Recall by approximately 0.07.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:004</p></details> |

These methods face sustainability challenges due to the diversity of pathologies and the labor-intensive nature of data collection. To address these limitations, we highlight the need for universal multimodal embeddings that can support multiple downstream tasks. Previous approaches involve fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which handle images and texts separately, limiting their ability to capture complex multimodal relationships. Additionally, these models are evaluated across diverse datasets without a unified benchmark. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate pathology universal embeddings to address these challenges. Our contributions can be summarized in the following aspects: 1) We propose MLLM4PUE, a novel framework that leverages MLLMs to generate embeddings for various pathology downstream tasks. 2) We further introduce the Pathology Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (PMEB), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the quality of pathology multimodal embeddings, which comprises 16 original tasks drawn from 15 datasets. 3) Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MLLM4PUE, illustrating MLLM-based models can effectively support a wide range of downstream tasks and unify the research direction for foundation models in pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology Image Restoration via Mixture of Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12399v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In digital pathology, acquiring all-in-focus images is essential to high-quality imaging and high-efficient clinical workflow. Traditional scanners achieve this by scanning at multiple focal planes of varying depths and then merging them, which is relatively slow and often struggles with complex tissue defocus. Recent prevailing image restoration technique provides a means to restore high-quality pathology images from scans of single focal planes. However, existing image restoration methods are inadequate, due to intricate defocus patterns in pathology images and their domain-specific semantic complexities. In this work, we devise a two-stage restoration solution cascading a transformer and a diffusion model, to benefit from their powers in preserving image fidelity and perceptual quality, respectively. We particularly propose a novel mixture of prompts for the two-stage solution. Given initial prompt that models defocus in microscopic imaging, we design two prompts that describe the high-level image semantics from pathology foundation model and the fine-grained tissue structures via edge extraction. We demonstrate that, by feeding the prompt mixture to our method, we can restore high-quality pathology images from single-focal-plane scans, implying high potentials of the mixture of prompts to clinical usage.

Standard compression methods, such as JPEG, reduce file sizes but often fail to preserve fine-grained phenotypic details critical for downstream tasks. In this work, we repurpose autoencoders (AEs) designed for Latent Diffusion Models as an efficient learned compression framework for pathology images. We systematically benchmark three AE models with varying compression levels and evaluate their reconstruction ability using pathology foundation models. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy to further enhance reconstruction fidelity that optimizes a pathology-specific learned perceptual metric. We validate our approach on downstream tasks, including segmentation, patch classification, and multiple instance learning, showing that replacing images with AE-compressed reconstructions leads to minimal performance degradation. Additionally, we propose a K-means clustering-based quantization method for AE latents, improving storage efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality. We provide the weights of the fine-tuned autoencoders at https://huggingface.co/collections/StonyBrook-CVLab/pathology-fine-tuned-aes-67d45f223a659ff2e3402dd0.</p></details> |  |

Methods: We evaluate six machine learning (ML) algorithms -- support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and AdaBoost -- using grid search for feasible hyperparameters and 20480 different feature subsets. Top 1000 classification models -- feature subset combinations for each ML algorithm are validated with repeated stratified cross-validation. To address class imbalance, we apply K-Means SMOTE to augment the training data. Results: Our approach achieves 85.61%, 84.69% and 85.22% unweighted average recall (UAR) for females, males and combined results respectively. We intentionally omit accuracy as it is a highly biased metric for imbalanced data.

A pre-analytical task within this process is the verification of the number of specimen fragments, a process that ensures that the number of fragments on a slide matches the number documented in the macroscopic report. This step is important to ensure that the slides contain the appropriate diagnostic material from the grossing process, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy of subsequent microscopic examination and diagnosis. Traditionally, this assessment is performed manually, requiring significant time and effort while being subject to significant variability due to its subjective nature. To address these challenges, this study explores an automated approach to fragment counting using the YOLOv9 and Vision Transformer models. Our results demonstrate that the automated system achieves a level of performance comparable to expert assessments, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to manual counting. Additionally, we present findings on interobserver variability, showing that the automated approach achieves an accuracy of 86%, which falls within the range of variation observed among experts (82-88%), further supporting its potential for integration into routine pathology workflows.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Since ST is closely related to pathological features such as disease subtypes, it may be valuable to augment image representation with pathological information. However, there are no attempts to leverage ST for image recognition ({\it i.e,} patch-level classification of subtypes of pathological image.). One of the big challenges is significant batch effects in spatial transcriptomics that make it difficult to extract pathological features of images from ST. In this paper, we propose a batch-agnostic contrastive learning framework that can extract consistent signals from gene expression of ST in multiple patients. To extract consistent signals from ST, we utilize the batch-agnostic gene encoder that is trained in a variational inference manner.

However, the ultra-high resolution of WSIs presents significant modeling challenges. Recent advancements in pathology foundation models have improved performance, yet most approaches rely on [CLS] token representation of tile ViT as slide-level inputs (16x16 pixels is refereed as patch and 224x224 pixels as tile). This discards critical spatial details from patch tokens, limiting downstream WSI analysis tasks. We find that leveraging all spatial patch tokens benefits WSI analysis but incurs nearly 200x higher storage and training costs (e.g., 196 tokens in ViT$_{224}$). To address this, we introduce vector quantized (VQ) distillation on patch feature, which efficiently compresses spatial patch tokens using discrete indices and a decoder. Our method reduces token dimensionality from 1024 to 16, achieving a 64x compression rate while preserving reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a multi-scale VQ (MSVQ) strategy, which not only enhances VQ reconstruction performance but also serves as a Self-supervised Learning (SSL) supervision for a seamless slide-level pretraining objective. Built upon the quantized patch features and supervision targets of tile via MSVQ, we develop a progressive convolutional module and slide-level SSL to extract representations with rich spatial-information for downstream WSI tasks. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in WSI analysis. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

Despite their impressive performance, these models often exhibit variability when applied to different tasks, prompting the need for a unified framework capable of consistently excelling across various applications. In this work, we propose Shazam, a novel framework designed to efficiently combine multiple CPath models. Unlike previous approaches that train a fixed-parameter FM, Shazam dynamically extracts and refines information from diverse FMs for each specific task. To ensure that each FM contributes effectively without dominance, a novel distillation strategy is applied, guiding the student model with features from all teacher models, which enhances its generalization ability. Experimental results on two pathology patch classification datasets demonstrate that Shazam outperforms existing CPath models and other fusion methods. Its lightweight, flexible design makes it a promising solution for improving CPath analysis in real-world settings.

The key innovation lies in RMA-Mamba's ability to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining precise local feature representation through its hierarchical processing pipeline. By integrating Vision Mamba (VMamba)'s efficient sequence modeling with RMA's targeted feature refinement, our architecture achieves superior feature learning across multiple scales. This dual-mechanism approach enables robust handling of complex morphological patterns while maintaining computational efficiency.

| **[Beyond H&E: Unlocking Pathological Insights with Polarization via Self-supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05933v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology image analysis is fundamental to digital pathology, with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as the gold standard for diagnostic and prognostic assessments. While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose PolarHE, a dual modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the polarization ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. Moreover, polarization property visualization reveals distinct optical signatures of pathological tissues, highlighting its diagnostic potential. t-SNE visualizations further confirm our model effectively captures both shared and unique modality features, reinforcing the complementary nature of polarization imaging. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models. Our code will be released after paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |
| **[Fast and Accurate Gigapixel Pathological Image Classification with Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21130v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to processing numerous patches from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, accepted by CVPR2025</p></details> |

Using the TORGO dataset, we address data scarcity and privacy challenges in speech-language pathology. Our contributions include demonstrating that voice cloning preserves dysarthric speech characteristics, analyzing differences between real and synthetic data, and discussing implications for diagnostics, rehabilitation, and communication. We cloned voices from dysarthric and control speakers using a commercial platform, ensuring gender-matched synthetic voices. A licensed speech-language pathologist (SLP) evaluated a subset for dysarthria, speaker gender, and synthetic indicators. The SLP correctly identified dysarthria in all cases and speaker gender in 95% but misclassified 30% of synthetic samples as real, indicating high realism. Our results suggest synthetic speech effectively captures disordered characteristics and that voice cloning has advanced to produce high-quality data resembling real speech, even to trained professionals. This has critical implications for healthcare, where synthetic data can mitigate data scarcity, protect privacy, and enhance AI-driven diagnostics. By enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality speech datasets, voice cloning can improve generalizable models, personalize therapy, and advance assistive technologies for dysarthria. We publicly release our synthetic dataset to foster further research and collaboration, aiming to develop robust models that improve patient outcomes in speech-language pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, spatial, semantic, and decision entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling. Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent decision-making process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/Prince-Lee-PathAI/PG-CIDL</p></details> |

However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of instances.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.13725</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17982v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area.

This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlights)</p></details> |

However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based system to improve cribriform pattern detection. Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430 patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261 slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort. Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62. Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions for prostate cancer patients.</p></details> |  |

Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

| **[A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06769v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning (DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, accepted conference paper at SPIE REMOTE SENSING, 3-7 September 2023, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[From Segments to Concepts: Interpretable Image Classification via Concept-Guided Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04180v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision; however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent, concept-level explanations.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.</p></details> | Submitted to Array |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.

| **[PathGene: Benchmarking Driver Gene Mutations and Exon Prediction Using Multicenter Lung Cancer Histopathology Image Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00096v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

| **[IPGPhormer: Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer for Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12381v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

We proposed a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which were processed by LLMs to infer multiple distortion instances, each with a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and LLM-inferred salience scores improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity. Our results suggested a psychologically grounded and generalizable approach for fine-grained reasoning in mental health NLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Instance Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06544v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore multiple instance verification, a problem setting in which a query instance is verified against a bag of target instances with heterogeneous, unknown relevancy. We show that naive adaptations of attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods and standard verification methods like Siamese neural networks are unsuitable for this setting: directly combining state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and Siamese networks is shown to be no better, and sometimes significantly worse, than a simple baseline model. Postulating that this may be caused by the failure of the representation of the target bag to incorporate the query instance, we introduce a new pooling approach named "cross-attention pooling" (CAP). Under the CAP framework, we propose two novel attention functions to address the challenge of distinguishing between highly similar instances in a target bag. Through empirical studies on three different verification tasks, we demonstrate that CAP outperforms adaptations of SOTA MIL methods and the baseline by substantial margins, in terms of both classification accuracy and the ability to detect key instances. The superior ability to identify key instances is attributed to the new attention functions by ablation studies. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV.</p></details> | JMLR 2025 |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency.

| **[Weakly Supervised Vulnerability Localization via Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11312v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerability detection has emerged as a significant concern in the field of software security recently, capturing the attention of numerous researchers and developers. Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained vulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the developers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large volume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific vulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of vulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization usually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling vulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence, the demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at the statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via multiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level labels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a function is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the vulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically, inspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the ground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual statements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These pseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level representation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach achieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art performance in statement-level vulnerability localization.</p></details> |  |

| **[MSCPT: Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification with Multi-scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11505v3)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become a standard paradigm for the weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025 Workshop COMPAYL</p></details> |

Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective, motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50 features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE = 10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Multiple instance learning (MIL) remains an essential next step following foundation model, designing a framework to aggregate patch-level features into slide-level predictions. We present EAGLE-Net, a structure-preserving, attention-guided MIL architecture designed to augment prediction and interpretability. EAGLE-Net integrates multi-scale absolute spatial encoding to capture global tissue architecture, a top-K neighborhood-aware loss to focus attention on local microenvironments, and background suppression loss to minimize false positives. We benchmarked EAGLE-Net on large pan-cancer datasets, including three cancer types for classification (10,260 slides) and seven cancer types for survival prediction (4,172 slides), using three distinct histology foundation backbones (REMEDIES, Uni-V1, Uni2-h). Across tasks, EAGLE-Net achieved up to 3% higher classification accuracy and the top concordance indices in 6 of 7 cancer types, producing smooth, biologically coherent attention maps that aligned with expert annotations and highlighted invasive fronts, necrosis, and immune infiltration. These results position EAGLE-Net as a generalizable, interpretable framework that complements foundation models, enabling improved biomarker discovery, prognostic modeling, and clinical decision support</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 7 main Figures, 8 Extended Data Figures</p></details> |

Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

Most prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield prediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single value, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights offered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county at the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed information within a county. In addition, our method addresses the "mixed pixel" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and crop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder accurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to automatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the influence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years in the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83. This paper demonstrates the advantages of our approach from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, through an in-depth study of the relationship between mixed pixels and attention, it is verified that our approach can capture critical feature information while filtering out noise from mixed pixels.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am writing to request the resubmission of my paper submitted to arXiv</p></details> |
| **[Controllable Latent Space Augmentation for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14588v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

Due to the lack of fine-grained behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMSL significantly improves the performance of behavior-level insider threat detection.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features. Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images. Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces. Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology, suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI2026 |

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

| **[Compact and De-biased Negative Instance Embedding for Multi-Instance Learning on Whole-Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10595v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) classification is a challenging task because 1) patches from WSI lack annotation, and 2) WSI possesses unnecessary variability, e.g., stain protocol. Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/pathology_mil.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Approaching Maximal Information Extraction in Low-Signal Regimes via Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07114v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a new machine learning (ML) methodology to obtain more precise predictions for some parameters of interest in a given hypotheses testing problem. Our proposed method also allows ML models to have more discriminative power in cases where it is extremely challenging for state-of-the-art classifiers to have any level of accurate predictions. This method can also allow us to systematically decrease the error from ML models in their predictions. In this paper, we provide a mathematical motivation why Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) would have more predictive power over their single-instance counterparts. We support our theoretical claims by analyzing the behavior of the MIL models through their scaling behaviors with respect to the number of instances on which the model makes predictions. As a concrete application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We show that under certain circumstances, it might be possible to extract the theoretical maximum Fisher Information latent in a dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning for Hematologic Disease Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04368v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2025 workshop on Efficient Medical AI</p></details> |

To address the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs. Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians consider relevant to RA progression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI AMAI Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdvDINO: Domain-Adversarial Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Spatial Proteomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04955v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach for learning visual representations without manual annotations. However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting EGFR Mutation in LUAD from Histopathological Whole-Slide Images Using Pretrained Foundation Model and Transfer Learning: An Indian Cohort Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01352v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01293v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Priority-Aware Clinical Pathology Hierarchy Training for Multiple Instance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20469v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios. Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with multiple symptoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for oral presentation by The 2nd MICCAI Student Board (MSB) EMERGE Workshop</p></details> |

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

Accurate early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is essential for guiding personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we present an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework designed to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) directly from pre-treatment hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy slides. The model was trained on a retrospective in-house cohort of 174 TNBC patients and externally validated on an independent cohort (n = 30). It achieved a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 during five-fold cross-validation and 0.78 on external testing, demonstrating robust predictive performance and generalizability. To enhance model interpretability, attention maps were spatially co-registered with multiplex immuno-histochemistry (mIHC) data stained for PD-L1, CD8+ T cells, and CD163+ macrophages. The attention regions exhibited moderate spatial overlap with immune-enriched areas, with mean Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.47 for PD-L1, 0.45 for CD8+ T cells, and 0.46 for CD163+ macrophages. The presence of these biomarkers in high-attention regions supports their biological relevance to NACT response in TNBC. This not only improves model interpretability but may also inform future efforts to identify clinically actionable histological biomarkers directly from H&E-stained biopsy slides, further supporting the utility of this approach for accurate NACT response prediction and advancing precision oncology in TNBC.</p></details> |  |

Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, a critical limitation of current MIL methods lies in the underutilization of pre-training for the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches initialize the aggregator randomly and train it from scratch, making performance highly sensitive to the quantity of labeled WSIs and ignoring the abundance of unlabeled WSIs commonly available in clinical settings. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating PreMix as a plug-in module into HIPT yields an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training sizes and datasets. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |

SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text, 2 page references, 2 page appendix; under submission</p></details> |

Accurate detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs, especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments, reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and 98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

We propose ProDisc-VAD, an efficient framework tackling this via two synergistic components. The Prototype Interaction Layer (PIL) provides controlled normality modeling using a small set of learnable prototypes, establishing a robust baseline without being overwhelmed by dominant normal data. The Pseudo-Instance Discriminative Enhancement (PIDE) loss boosts separability by applying targeted contrastive learning exclusively to the most reliable extreme-scoring instances (highest/lowest scores). ProDisc-VAD achieves strong AUCs (97.98% ShanghaiTech, 87.12% UCF-Crime) using only 0.4M parameters, over 800x fewer than recent ViT-based methods like VadCLIP.

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08178v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/MIL-JigsawPuzzles.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05077v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are increasingly applied for automated histopathology. Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering it computationally infeasible to analyze them entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- {\it S}equential {\it A}ttention-based {\it S}ampling for {\it H}istopathological {\it A}nalysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches, to achieve reliable diagnosis. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high-resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Trilemma of Truth in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23921v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed. To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither. sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their probabilistic internal knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02395v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

Although AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly, we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748 images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.

While existing solutions rely on complex architectural modifications or additional processing steps, we introduce Attention Entropy Maximization (AEM), a simple yet effective regularization technique. Our investigation reveals the positive correlation between attention entropy and model performance. Building on this insight, we integrate AEM regularization into the MIL framework to penalize excessive attention concentration. To address sensitivity to the AEM weight parameter, we implement Cosine Weight Annealing, reducing parameter dependency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate AEM's superior performance across diverse feature extractors, MIL frameworks, attention mechanisms, and augmentation techniques.

WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

| **[MiCo: Multiple Instance Learning with Context-Aware Clustering for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18028v2)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/junjianli106/MiCo.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Cross-Level Multi-Instance Distillation for Self-Supervised Fine-Grained Visual Categorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08860v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality annotation of fine-grained visual categories demands great expert knowledge, which is taxing and time consuming. Alternatively, learning fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g., species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution. However, recent researches find that existing self-supervised learning methods are less qualified to represent fine-grained categories. The bottleneck lies in that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding, while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation (CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft show that the proposed method outperforms the contemporary method by upto 10.14% and existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches by upto 19.78% on both top-1 accuracy and Rank-1 retrieval metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |

In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based MIL classifiers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepeted for oral presentation at Medical Image Understanding and Analysis (MIUA) 2025</p></details> |
| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel selective scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling, efficient alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this limitation by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan that restores a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward selective scan and executes it entirely in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a scalable vision backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate the versatility of our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs). We show that our LBVim constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. That is under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. We also integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, MambaMIL, which uses single directional scan. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets for show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.</p></details> | Submitted to TMLR |
| **[Do Multiple Instance Learning Models Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09022v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a cornerstone approach in computational pathology (CPath) for generating clinically meaningful slide-level embeddings from gigapixel tissue images. However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath. Lastly, we provide a resource which standardizes the implementation of MIL models and collection of pretrained model weights on popular CPath tasks, available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight). 20 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-modal Foundation Proceedings of ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-modal Foundation Proceedings of ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-modal Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Life Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Single GPU Task Adaptation of Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05184v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research.

This makes it difficult to not only collect consistent annotations across a dataset but also to validate them, as no two annotators are likely to label the same object using the exact same coordinates. These challenges are further compounded when object boundaries are partially visible or blurred, which can be the case in many domains. Training on noisy annotations significantly degrades detector performance, rendering them unusable, particularly in few-shot settings, where just a few corrupted annotations can impact model performance. In this work, we propose FMG-Det, a simple, efficient methodology for training models with noisy annotations. More specifically, we propose combining a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework with a pre-processing pipeline that leverages powerful foundation models to correct labels prior to training. This pre-processing pipeline, along with slight modifications to the detector head, results in state-of-the-art performance across a number of datasets, for both standard and few-shot scenarios, while being much simpler and more efficient than other approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, ICIP 2025 |

Here, we compare the performance of two machine learning models - FMCIB+XGBoost, a supervised model with domain-specific pretraining, and Dinov2+ABMIL, a self-supervised model with attention-based multiple-instance learning - on 3D lung nodule data from the Stanford Radiogenomics and Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohorts. In the task of KRAS and EGFR mutation detection, FMCIB+XGBoost consistently outperformed Dinov2+ABMIL, achieving accuracies of 0.846 and 0.883 for KRAS and EGFR mutations, respectively. In cancer staging, Dinov2+ABMIL demonstrated competitive generalization, achieving an accuracy of 0.797 for T-stage prediction in the Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohort, suggesting SSL's adaptability across diverse datasets. Our results emphasize the clinical utility of supervised models in mutation detection and highlight the potential of SSL to improve staging generalization, while identifying areas for enhancement in mutation sensitivity.</p></details> |  |

Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of our paper accepted at IJCAI2025, with detailed proofs and additional experimental results</p></details> |
| **[Self-Classification Enhancement and Correction for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16294v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted much attention due to its low labeling cost. The success of recent WSOD models is often ascribed to the two-stage multi-class classification (MCC) task, i.e., multiple instance learning and online classification refinement. Despite achieving non-trivial progresses, these methods overlook potential classification ambiguities between these two MCC tasks and fail to leverage their unique strengths. In this work, we introduce a novel WSOD framework to ameliorate these two issues. For one thing, we propose a self-classification enhancement module that integrates intra-class binary classification (ICBC) to bridge the gap between the two distinct MCC tasks. The ICBC task enhances the network's discrimination between positive and mis-located samples in a class-wise manner and forges a mutually reinforcing relationship with the MCC task. For another, we propose a self-classification correction algorithm during inference, which combines the results of both MCC tasks to effectively reduce the mis-classified predictions. Extensive experiments on the prevalent VOC 2007 & 2012 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Linearity: Squeeze-and-Recalibrate Blocks for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15504v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters and no architectural changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04045v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14783v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions, preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data. A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs, and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |

Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep learning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine learning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We demonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal cancer modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>camer...</summary><p>camera ready version for ML4H 2025</p></details> |

Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG), employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited annotated data.</p></details> |  |

Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |

Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21191v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods.

Methods: Glo-UMF decouples quantification tasks by constructing three dedicated deep models: an ultrastructure segmentation model, a glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) region classification model, and an electron-dense deposits (EDD) detection model. Their outputs are integrated through a post-processing workflow with adaptive GFB cropping and measurement location screening, enhancing measurement reliability and providing comprehensive quantitative results that overcome the limitations of traditional grading. Results: Trained on 372 electron microscopy images, Glo-UMF enables simultaneous quantification of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and EDD location. In 115 test cases spanning 9 renal pathological types, the automated quantification results showed strong agreement with pathological reports, with an average processing time of 4.23$\pm$0.48 seconds per case on a CPU environment. Conclusions: The modular design of Glo-UMF allows for flexible extensibility, supporting the joint quantification of multiple features. This framework ensures robust generalization and clinical applicability, demonstrating significant potential as an efficient auxiliary tool in glomerular pathological analysis.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

| **[DiagR1: A Vision-Language Model Trained via Reinforcement Learning for Digestive Pathology Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18433v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Pathology Report Generation and Multimodal Representation Learning for Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19293v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of melanocytic skin lesions are examined by pathologists each year, the majority of which concern common nevi (i.e., ordinary moles). While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |
| **[PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10536v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Whole Slide Foundation Model for Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19666v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |
