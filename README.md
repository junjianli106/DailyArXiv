| **[PathFound: An Agentic Multimodal Model Activating Evidence-seeking Pathological Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23545v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Learning with Multi-Stage Vision Transformers on Inter-Modality HER2 Status Scoring and Tumor Classification on Whole Slides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22335v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring</p></details> |  |
| **[TICON: A Slide-Level Tile Contextualizer for Histopathology Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21331v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[WSD-MIL: Window Scale Decay Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19982v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[HistoWAS: A Pathomics Framework for Large-Scale Feature-Wide Association Studies of Tissue Topology and Patient Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19954v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeltaMIL: Gated Memory Integration for Efficient and Discriminative Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19331v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are typically analyzed using multiple instance learning (MIL) methods. However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\% with UNI features. These results demonstrate the strong and consistent performance of DeltaMIL across diverse WSI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,7 figures,8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Breast Cancer Recurrence Risk Prediction Based on Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18734v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting breast cancer recurrence risk is a critical clinical challenge. This study investigates the potential of computational pathology to stratify patients using deep learning on routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). We developed and compared three Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks -- CLAM-SB, ABMIL, and ConvNeXt-MIL-XGBoost -- on an in-house dataset of 210 patient cases. The models were trained to predict 5-year recurrence risk, categorized into three tiers (low, medium, high), with ground truth labels established by the 21-gene Recurrence Score. Features were extracted using the UNI and CONCH pre-trained models. In a 5-fold cross-validation, the modified CLAM-SB model demonstrated the strongest performance, achieving a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.836 and a classification accuracy of 76.2%. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning on standard histology slides for automated, genomics-correlated risk stratification, highlighting a promising pathway toward rapid and cost-effective clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[HookMIL: Revisiting Context Modeling in Multiple Instance Learning for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22188v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability. Codes are available at https://github.com/lingxitong/HookMIL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Segmentation and Classification of Alpha-Synuclein Aggregates in Brightfield Midbrain Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16268v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.</p></details> |  |
| **[MambaMIL+: Modeling Long-Term Contextual Patterns for Gigapixel Whole Slide Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17726v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) are an important data modality in computational pathology, yet their gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations challenge conventional deep learning models. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[PathFLIP: Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining for Versatile Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17621v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable progress in computational pathology (CPath), the gigapixel scale and spatial heterogeneity of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) continue to pose challenges for multimodal understanding. Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Democratizing Pathology Co-Pilots: An Open Pipeline and Dataset for Whole-Slide Vision-Language Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17326v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to become co-pilots for pathologists. However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-α, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-α trained with different amounts of data. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PANDA-PLUS-Bench: A Clinical Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of AI Foundation Models in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14922v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[A Multicenter Benchmark of Multiple Instance Learning Models for Lymphoma Subtyping from HE-stained Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14640v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD): A Self-Supervised Framework for Unified Representation Learning in Gigapixel Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14796v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables, submitted to AMIA 2026 Informatics Summit</p></details> |
| **[Renal Cell Carcinoma subtyping: learning from multi-resolution localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09471v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renal Cell Carcinoma is typically asymptomatic at the early stages for many patients. This leads to a late diagnosis of the tumor, where the curability likelihood is lower, and makes the mortality rate of Renal Cell Carcinoma high, with respect to its incidence rate. To increase the survival chance, a fast and correct categorization of the tumor subtype is paramount. Nowadays, computerized methods, based on artificial intelligence, represent an interesting opportunity to improve the productivity and the objectivity of the microscopy-based Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, much of their exploitation is hampered by the paucity of annotated dataset, essential for a proficient training of supervised machine learning technologies. This study sets out to investigate a novel self supervised training strategy for machine learning diagnostic tools, based on the multi-resolution nature of the histological samples. We aim at reducing the need of annotated dataset, without significantly reducing the accuracy of the tool. We demonstrate the classification capability of our tool on a whole slide imaging dataset for Renal Cancer subtyping, and we compare our solution with several state-of-the-art classification counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMILIA: interpretable multiple instance learning for inflammation prediction in IBD from H&E whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13440v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Histopathologic Assessment of Hirschsprung Disease Using a Multi-Stage Vision Transformer Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20734v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hirschsprung Disease is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. Therefore, the correct identification of ganglion cells is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage analysis framework that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework, based on a Vision Transformer model (ViT-B/16), sequentially segments the muscularis propria, segments the myenteric plexus, and detects ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For ganglion cells annotated with high certainty, the model achieved 62.1\% precision and 89.1% recall. When considering all annotated ganglion cells, regardless of certainty level, the overall precision was 67.0%. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Weak-to-Strong Generalization Enables Fully Automated De Novo Training of Multi-head Mask-RCNN Model for Segmenting Densely Overlapping Cell Nuclei in Multiplex Whole-slice Brain Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11722v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a weak to strong generalization methodology for fully automated training of a multi-head extension of the Mask-RCNN method with efficient channel attention for reliable segmentation of overlapping cell nuclei in multiplex cyclic immunofluorescent (IF) whole-slide images (WSI), and present evidence for pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, the key phenomena underlying weak to strong generalization. This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Learning for Scalable Representation of High-Dimensional Medical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13115v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with healthcare data is rapidly transforming medical diagnostics and driving progress toward precision medicine. However, effectively leveraging multimodal data, particularly digital pathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic sequencing, remains a significant challenge due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of these modalities and the need for scalable and interpretable frameworks. Existing diagnostic models typically operate on unimodal data, overlooking critical cross-modal interactions that can yield richer clinical insights. We introduce MarbliX (Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX), a self-supervised framework that learns to embed WSIs and immunogenomic profiles into compact, scalable binary codes, termed ``monogram.'' By optimizing a triplet contrastive objective across modalities, MarbliX captures high-resolution patient similarity in a unified latent space, enabling efficient retrieval of clinically relevant cases and facilitating case-based reasoning. \textcolor{black}{In lung cancer, MarbliX achieves 85-89\% across all evaluation metrics, outperforming histopathology (69-71\%) and immunogenomics (73-76\%). In kidney cancer, real-valued monograms yield the strongest performance (F1: 80-83\%, Accuracy: 87-90\%), with binary monograms slightly lower (F1: 78-82\%).</p></details> |  |
| **[MMAP: A Multi-Magnification and Prototype-Aware Architecture for Predicting Spatial Gene Expression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11344v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>Recei...</summary><p>Received Best Paper Award at the 2025 Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17982v5)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.</p></details> | 29 Pages, 10 figures |
| **[Graph Laplacian Transformer with Progressive Sampling for Prostate Cancer Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10808v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prostate cancer grading from whole-slide images (WSIs) remains a challenging task due to the large-scale nature of WSIs, the presence of heterogeneous tissue structures, and difficulty of selecting diagnostically relevant regions. Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |

Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs, while requiring significantly lower computation and memory.</p></details> | 20 pages |

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pages...</summary><p>Pages 4, Figures 1, Table 1</p></details> |

Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models designed for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification in computational pathology are rarely evaluated in terms of reliability, leaving a key gap in understanding their suitability for high-stakes applications like clinical decision-making. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing three quantitative metrics for reliability assessment and applying them to several widely used MIL architectures across three region-wise annotated pathology datasets. Our findings indicate that the mean pooling instance (MEAN-POOL-INS)model demonstrates superior reliability compared to other networks, despite its simple architectural design and computational efficiency. These findings underscore the need of reliability evaluation alongside predictive performance in MIL models and establish MEAN-POOL-INS as a strong, trustworthy baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, accepted for oral presentation at SPIE Medical Imaging, 2026</p></details> |

These methods may assign high attention weights to non-tumor regions, such as staining biases or artifacts, leading to unreliable tumor region localization. In this paper, we revisit max-pooling-based MIL methods from a causal perspective. Under mild assumptions, our theoretical results demonstrate that max-pooling encourages the model to focus on causal factors while ignoring bias-related factors. Furthermore, we discover that existing max-pooling-based methods may overfit the training set through rote memorization of instance features and fail to learn meaningful patterns. To address these issues, we propose FocusMIL, which couples max-pooling with an instance-level variational information bottleneck (VIB) to learn compact, predictive latent representations, and employs a multi-bag mini-batch scheme to stabilize optimization. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets and one semi-synthetic dataset. The results show that, by capturing causal factors, FocusMIL exhibits significant advantages in out-of-distribution scenarios and instance-level tumor region localization tasks.</p></details> |  |

While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.</p></details> |  |

Publicly available histopathology datasets remain scarce, and those that do exist predominantly represent Western populations. Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium). All slides were de-identified and are provided in their native formats without further conversion. The dataset enables grading concordance analyses, color normalization, and cross-scanner robustness evaluations. Data will be deposited in the Bioimage Archive (BIA) under accession code: to be announced (TBA), and released under a CC BY 4.0 license.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, there are unique problems in pathology, such as annotated data scarcity, privacy regulations in data sharing, and inherently generative tasks like virtual staining. Generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address these problems through image synthesis. We introduce PixCell, the first generative foundation model for histopathology images. PixCell is a diffusion model trained on PanCan-30M, a large, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H&E-stained whole slide images of various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any human-annotated data. By conditioning on real slides, the synthetic images capture the properties of the real data and can be used as data augmentation for small-scale datasets to boost classification performance. We prove the foundational versatility of PixCell by applying it to two generative downstream tasks: privacy-preserving synthetic data generation and virtual IHC staining. PixCell's high-fidelity conditional generation enables institutions to use their private data to synthesize highly realistic, site-specific surrogate images that can be shared in place of raw patient data. Furthermore, using datasets of roughly paired H&E-IHC tiles, we learn to translate PixCell's conditioning from H&E to multiple IHC stains, allowing the generation of IHC images from H&E inputs. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page - https://histodiffusion.github.io/docs/projects/pixcell</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Training Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

| **[Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13482v4)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm in which each cancer corresponds to a single model. However, this paradigm naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot leverage knowledge from other cancers. While multi-task learning frameworks have been explored recently, they often place high demands on computational resources and require extensive training on ultra-large, multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper shifts the paradigm to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It comprises three major parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors). (2) Beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmarking, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism behind transferability. (3) We further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. CROPKT could serve as an inception that lays the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

However, existing models are predominantly trained on surgical pathology data, which is enriched for non-nervous tissue and overrepresents neoplastic, inflammatory, metabolic, and other non-neurological diseases. Neuropathology represents a markedly different domain of histopathology, characterized by unique cell types (neurons, glia, etc.), distinct cytoarchitecture, and disease-specific pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, and pattern-specific neurodegeneration. This domain mismatch may limit the ability of general-purpose foundation models to capture the morphological patterns critical for interpreting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar ataxias. To address this gap, we developed NeuroFM, a foundation model trained specifically on whole-slide images of brain tissue spanning diverse neurodegenerative pathologies. NeuroFM demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose models across multiple neuropathology-specific downstream tasks, including mixed dementia disease classification, hippocampal region segmentation, and neurodegenerative ataxia identification encompassing cerebellar essential tremor and spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes. This work establishes that domain-specialized foundation models trained on brain tissue can better capture neuropathology-specific features than models trained on general surgical pathology datasets. By tailoring foundation models to the unique morphological landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, NeuroFM enables more accurate and reliable AI-based analysis for brain disease diagnosis and research, setting a precedent for domain-specific model development in specialized areas of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous labeling of surgical resection margins using a foundation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22131v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Histomorphology-Guided Prototypical Multi-Instance Learning for Breast Cancer WSI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17983v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histomorphology is crucial in cancer diagnosis. However, existing whole slide image (WSI) classification methods struggle to effectively incorporate histomorphology information, limiting their ability to capture key pathological features. Particularly when the number of instances within a bag is large and their features are complex, it becomes challenging to accurately identify instances decisive for the bag label, making these methods prone to interference from ambiguous instances. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Histomorphology-Guided Prototypical Multi-Instance Learning (HGPMIL) framework that explicitly learns histomorphology-guided prototypical representations by incorporating tumor cellularity, cellular morphology, and tissue architecture. Specifically, our approach consists of three key components: (1) estimating the importance of tumor-related histomorphology information at patch-level based on medical prior knowledge; (2) generating representative prototypes through histomorphology-prototypical clustering; and (3) enabling WSI classification through histomorphology-guided prototypical aggregation. HGPMIL adjusts the decision boundary by incorporating histomorphological importance to reduce instance label uncertainty, thereby reversely optimizing the bag-level boundary. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving high diagnostic accuracy for molecular subtyping, cancer subtyping and survival analysis.

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

| **[PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

While traditional histopathological assessment remains the standard, deep learning offers a promising path toward objective and automated analysis of whole slide images. For the BraTS-Path 2025 Challenge, we developed a method that fine-tunes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a dedicated classification head on the official training dataset. Our model's performance on the online validation set, evaluated via the Synapse platform, yielded a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.7064 and an F1-score of 0.7676.

| **[CORE -- A Cell-Level Coarse-to-Fine Image Registration Engine for Multi-stain Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03826v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient registration of whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for high-resolution, nuclei-level analysis in multi-stained tissue slides. We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-Adapting Gated Experts: Dynamic Expert Routing for Colonoscopic Lesion Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18493v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce PathFMTools, a lightweight, extensible Python package that enables efficient execution, analysis, and visualization of pathology foundation models. We use this tool to interface with and evaluate two state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models, CONCH and MUSK, on the task of histological grading in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a critical criterion that informs cSCC staging and patient management. Using a cohort of 440 cSCC H&E WSIs, we benchmark multiple adaptation strategies, demonstrating trade-offs across prediction approaches and validating the potential of using foundation model embeddings to train small specialist models. These findings underscore the promise of pathology foundation models for real-world clinical applications, with PathFMTools enabling efficient analysis and validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 5th Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Gigapixel Pathology Images with Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19652v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being widely used to support clinical care, general-purpose large multimodal models (LMMs) have generally shown poor or inconclusive performance in medical image interpretation, particularly in pathology, where gigapixel images are used. However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%). Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current foundation models and ground future development of LMMs for expert reasoning in pathology.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference manuscript accepted for oral presentation at CASEIB 2025</p></details> |

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2026</p></details> |

It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Oral, extended version</p></details> |
| **[PathAgent: Toward Interpretable Analysis of Whole-slide Pathology Images via Large Language Model-based Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17052v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Recent advances in the pathology foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level multi-scale features from WSIs. However, current pathology FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantages of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of multi-scale heterogeneous pathology FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on diverse datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

The framework consists of four key stages designed to capture prognostic and morphological heterogeneity. First, a Quantile Based Patch Filtering module selects prognostically informative tissue regions through quantile thresholding. Second, Graph Regularized Patch Clustering models phenotype level variations using a k nearest neighbor graph that enforces spatial and morphological coherence. Third, Hierarchical Feature Aggregation learns both intra and inter cluster dependencies to represent multiscale tumor organization. Finally, an Expert Guided Mixture Density Model estimates complex survival distributions via Gaussian mixtures, enabling fine grained risk prediction. Evaluated on TCGA LUAD, TCGA KIRC, and TCGA BRCA cohorts, our model achieves concordance indices of 0.653 ,0.719 ,and 0.733 respectively, surpassing existing state of the art approaches in survival prediction from WSIs.</p></details> |  |

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues, show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

While computational methods predict gene expression from H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs), existing approaches often fail to capture the intricate biological heterogeneity within spots and are susceptible to morphological noise when integrating contextual information from surrounding tissue. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiFusion, a novel deep learning framework that integrates two complementary components. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Intra-Spot Modeling module that extracts fine-grained morphological representations through multi-resolution sub-patch decomposition, guided by a feature alignment loss to ensure semantic consistency across scales. Concurrently, we present the Context-aware Cross-scale Fusion module, which employs cross-attention to selectively incorporate biologically relevant regional context, thereby enhancing representational capacity. This architecture enables comprehensive modeling of both cellular-level features and tissue microenvironmental cues, which are essential for accurate gene expression prediction. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ST datasets demonstrate that HiFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across both 2D slide-wise cross-validation and more challenging 3D sample-specific scenarios. These results underscore HiFusion's potential as a robust, accurate, and scalable solution for ST inference from routine histopathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026. 7 pages (main text), 12 pages total including references and supplementary material. 6 figures</p></details> |

The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

We propose CellGenNet, a knowledge distillation framework for robust cross-tissue cell segmentation under limited supervision. CellGenNet adopts a student-teacher architecture, where a capacity teacher is trained on sparse annotations and generates soft pseudo-labels for unlabeled regions. The student is optimized using a joint objective that integrates ground-truth labels, teacher-derived probabilistic targets, and a hybrid loss function combining binary cross-entropy and Tversky loss, enabling asymmetric penalties to mitigate class imbalance and better preserve minority nuclear structures. Consistency regularization and layerwise dropout further stabilize feature representations and promote reliable feature transfer. Experiments across diverse cancer tissue WSIs show that CellGenNet improves segmentation accuracy and generalization over supervised and semi-supervised baselines, supporting scalable and reproducible histopathology analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to IEEE SSIAI 2026</p></details> |

Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction. It further demonstrated strong cross-model generalization, reliable uncertainty quantification, and robust survival stratification in multiple external cohorts. In conclusion, nnMIL offers a practical and generalizable solution for translating pathology foundation models into clinically meaningful predictions, advancing the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/Luoxd1996/nnMIL)</p></details> |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted in MICCAI Workshop 2025</p></details> |

However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering them computationally infeasible to analyze entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches to achieve reliable diagnoses. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features. Model implementation is available at: https://github.com/coglabiisc/SASHA.</p></details> |  |

However, manual examination of cytology whole slide images (WSIs) is slow, subjective, and depends heavily on expert pathologists. To address this, we introduce the first weakly supervised deep learning framework for patient-level diagnosis of oral cytology whole slide images, leveraging the newly released Oral Cytology Dataset [1], which provides annotated cytology WSIs from ten medical centres across India. Each patient case is represented as a bag of cytology patches and assigned a diagnosis label (Healthy, Benign, Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMD), OSCC) by an in-house expert pathologist. These patient-level weak labels form a new extension to the dataset. We evaluate a baseline multiple-instance learning (MIL) model and a proposed Region-Affinity Attention MIL (RAA-MIL) that models spatial relationships between regions within each slide. The RAA-MIL achieves an average accuracy of 72.7%, weighted F1-score of 0.69 on an unseen test set, outperforming the baseline. This study establishes the first patient-level weakly supervised benchmark for oral cytology and moves toward reliable AI-assisted digital pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at IEEE ISBI 2026</p></details> |
| **[MeCaMIL: Causality-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Fair and Interpretable Whole Slide Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11004v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology.

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures.

| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan to restore a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward scan and executes it in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs) and show that it constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. Under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. Our method also boosts the accuracy of four SOTA Mamba models, namely VMamba, LocalVim, PlainMamba and Adventurer, by 0.5% to 3.4%. We integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) model, MambaMIL, which is unidirectional. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/LBMamba.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoPS: Evolutionary Patch Selection for Whole Slide Image Analysis in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07560v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, the gigapixel scale of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates their division into thousands of smaller patches. Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |

Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and morphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their gigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and analysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain normalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by fragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight, open-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI preprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation management, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with modern pathology foundation models. By unifying these processes, it streamlines WSI preprocessing, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates the generation of AI-ready datasets, enabling researchers to focus on model development and downstream analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 3figures, published to ACM Digital Library</p></details> |

However, existing public CRC datasets often lack morphologic diversity, suffer from class imbalance, and contain low-quality image tiles, limiting model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford coloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue classification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image tiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000 tiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++, designed to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an encoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors from tiles within each whole-slide image. Then, K-means clustering groups morphologically similar tiles, followed by equal-frequency binning to sample diverse morphologic patterns within each class. The selected tiles are subsequently verified by expert gastrointestinal pathologists to ensure accuracy. This semi-automated process significantly reduces manual effort while producing high-quality, diverse tiles. To evaluate STARC-9, we benchmarked convolutional neural networks, transformers, and pathology-specific foundation models on multi-class CRC tissue classification and segmentation tasks, showing superior generalizability compared to models trained on existing datasets. Although we demonstrate the utility of DeepCluster++ on CRC as a pilot use-case, it is a flexible framework that can be used for constructing high-quality datasets from large WSI repositories across a wide range of cancer and non-cancer applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 18 figures, Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution, we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics, including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels. Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate translation towards routine use by pathologists.</p></details> |  |

However, spatial, semantic, and decision entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling. Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent decision-making process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/Prince-Lee-PathAI/PG-CIDL</p></details> |

Comprehensive datasets that combine histopathological images with genetic and survival data across various tumour sites are essential for advancing computational pathology and personalised medicine. We present SurGen, a dataset comprising 1,020 H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) from 843 colorectal cancer cases. The dataset includes detailed annotations for key genetic mutations (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) and mismatch repair status, as well as survival data for 426 cases. We illustrate SurGen's utility with a proof-of-concept model that predicts mismatch repair status directly from WSIs, achieving a test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8273. These preliminary results underscore the dataset's potential to facilitate research in biomarker discovery, prognostic modelling, and advanced machine learning applications in colorectal cancer and beyond. SurGen offers a valuable resource for the scientific community, enabling studies that require high-quality WSIs linked with comprehensive clinical and genetic information on colorectal cancer. Our initial findings affirm the dataset's capacity to advance diagnostic precision and foster the development of personalised treatment strategies in colorectal oncology.

These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |

To fill in this gap, we present PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs.

These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.</p></details> | 52 pages, 34 figures |

Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, static hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) file servers cannot natively stream subregions of high-resolution image files, such as the IFE. The majority of contemporary WSI viewer systems are designed as browser-based web applications and leverage OpenSeaDragon as the tile-based rendering framework. These systems convert WSI files to Deep Zoom Images (DZI) for compatibility with simple static HTTP file servers. To address this limitation, we have developed the Iris RESTful Server, a low-overhead HTTP server with a RESTful API that is natively compatible with the DICOMweb WADO-RS API. Written in C++ with Boost Beast HTTP and Asio networking libraries atop the public IFE libraries, the server offers both security and high performance. Testing shows that a single Raspberry Pi equivalent system can handle a peak of 5,061 req/s (average 3,883 req/s) with a median latency of 21 ms on a private (i.e. hospital) network. We also developed and merged a new OpenSeaDragon TileSource, compatible with the Iris RESTful API, into the next OpenSeaDragon release, enabling simple and immediate drop-in replacement of DZI images within WSI viewer stacks. Designed as a secure cross-origin resource sharing microservice, this architecture includes detailed deployment instructions for new or existing WSI workflows, and the public examples.restful.irisdigitalpathology.org subdomain is provided as a development tool to accelerate WSI web viewer development.

This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.</p></details> |  |

We built a pipeline to apply previously validated segmentation models of kidney structures and extract quantitative features from these structures. Such quantitative analysis also requires qualitative inspection of results for quality control, exploration, and communication. We extend the Vitessce web-based visualization tool to enable visualization of segmentations of multiple types of functional tissue units, such as, glomeruli, tubules, arteries/arterioles in the kidney. Moreover, we propose a standard representation for files containing multiple segmentation bitmasks, which we define polymorphically, such that existing formats including OME-TIFF, OME-NGFF, AnnData, MuData, and SpatialData can be used. We demonstrate that these methods enable researchers and the broader public to interactively explore datasets containing multiple segmented entities and associated features, including for exploration of renal morphometry of biopsies from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP).</p></details> |  |

However, real-world datasets often suffer from the problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete modalities scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15138v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semiparametric Gaussian Mixture Model with Spatial Dependence and Its Application to Whole-Slide Image Clustering Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16421v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop here a semiparametric Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) for unsupervised learning with valuable spatial information taken into consideration. Specifically, we assume for each instance a random location. Then, conditional on this random location, we assume for the feature vector a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed SGMM allows the mixing probability to be nonparametrically related to the spatial location. Compared with a classical GMM, SGMM is considerably more flexible and allows the instances from the same class to be spatially clustered. To estimate the SGMM, novel EM algorithms are developed and rigorous asymptotic theories are established. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate our finite sample performance. For a real application, we apply our SGMM method to the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images (WSIs) for breast cancer detection. The SGMM method demonstrates outstanding clustering performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCMIL: A Progressive Representation Learning of Whole Slide Images for Cancer Prognosis Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14403v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/tuuuc/DCMIL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Morphology-Aware Prognostic model for Five-Year Survival Prediction in Colorectal Cancer from H&E Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14800v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally, with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%; HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens, replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between treatments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPADE: Spatial Transcriptomics and Pathology Alignment Using a Mixture of Data Experts for an Expressive Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21857v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalisation of automatic tumour segmentation in histopathological whole-slide images across multiple cancer types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11182v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06113v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Hierarchical Geometry-guided Transformer for Histological Subtyping of Primary Liver Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05657v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, accepted by IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11846v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 μm on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 μm) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientMIL: Efficient Linear-Complexity MIL Method for WSI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23640v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.</p></details> | Submitted to Array |

However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/16812932 , our code is available at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/beetle , and our benchmark is available at https://beetle.grand-challenge.org/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic and Visual Crop-Guided Diffusion Models for Heterogeneous Tissue Synthesis in Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17847v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</p></details> |  |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[SlideMamba: Entropy-Based Adaptive Fusion of GNN and Mamba for Enhanced Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21239v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025. Copyright 2025 IEEE.

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with >92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods.

| **[SCORPION: Addressing Scanner-Induced Variability in Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20907v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UNSURE 2025 workshop in MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency.

| **[Cluster-Level Sparse Multi-Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11034v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering, within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones. This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles. Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).</p></details> | 12 pages,5 figures |

However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted manuscript of an article published in Medical Image Analysis (Elsevier).

However, existing open-source tools are often distributed as source code or Docker containers, requiring advanced programming skills that hinder accessibility for non-programmers, such as clinicians. Additionally, current models are typically trained on a single dataset and lack flexibility in adjusting confidence levels for predictions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GloFinder, a QuPath plugin designed for single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs with online editing through the graphical user interface (GUI). GloFinder employs CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework utilizing circle representations for precise object localization, with models trained on approximately 160,000 manually annotated glomeruli. To further enhance accuracy, the plugin incorporates Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), an ensemble method that combines confidence scores from multiple CircleNet models to produce refined predictions, achieving superior performance in glomerular detection. GloFinder enables direct visualization and editing of results in QuPath, facilitating seamless interaction for clinicians and providing a powerful tool for nephropathology research and clinical practice.

However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems.

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures.

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, the modalities available in clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records, and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities, making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.</p></details> |  |
| **[MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia, chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima. Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</p></details> |  |

The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science. When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects. We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs. Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes. We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.</p></details> |  |

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted precision oncology.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/lilab-stanford/ELF)</p></details> |

However, pathology images from different hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features, posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Pathology Co-pilot via Reasoning Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17303v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 Figures |

A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations.

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance.

Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms.

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation (AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16 dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times.

However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.</p></details> |  |

H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hypergraph Mamba for Efficient Whole Slide Image Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17457v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Conventional patch-based methods inevitably distort spatial relationships or treat patches as independent samples, while traditional attention mechanisms, designed for dense, uniformly distributed data, are computationally impractical for WSIs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse-native computational framework that preserves exact spatial relationships, unlocking advanced modeling techniques and bridging a long-standing gap between WSI analysis and general vision. Based on this framework, we develop Sparse Pyramid Attention Networks (SPAN), incorporating a hierarchical sparse pyramid attention architecture with shifted windows that efficiently directs computational resources to informative regions. SPAN comprises two key modules: Spatial-Adaptive Feature Condensation, which progressively builds multi-scale representations from a single-scale input through sparse downsampling, and Context-Aware Feature Refinement, which captures long-range dependencies via shifted windows and global tokens. Evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate SPAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating both our framework's effectiveness and SPAN's specific advantages in capturing contextual and hierachical representations that existing methods fundamentally cannot model. Our work establishes a new paradigm for WSI analysis that overcomes long-standing computational barriers. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We developed methods to predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists' attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Medical Image Analysis (MEDIA), Elsevier, 2025.

| **[Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745). Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas.

Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, a critical limitation of current MIL methods lies in the underutilization of pre-training for the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches initialize the aggregator randomly and train it from scratch, making performance highly sensitive to the quantity of labeled WSIs and ignoring the abundance of unlabeled WSIs commonly available in clinical settings. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating PreMix as a plug-in module into HIPT yields an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training sizes and datasets. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i) multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides, with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection, and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides.

Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |

SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text, 2 page references, 2 page appendix; under submission</p></details> |

While recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models. Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods.

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931).

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces DepViT-CAD, a deployable AI system for multi-class cancer diagnosis in histopathology. At its core is MAViT, a novel Multi-Attention Vision Transformer designed to capture fine-grained morphological patterns across diverse tumor types. MAViT was trained on expert-annotated patches from 1008 whole-slide images, covering 11 diagnostic categories, including 10 major cancers and non-tumor tissue. DepViT-CAD was validated on two independent cohorts: 275 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas and 50 routine clinical cases from pathology labs, achieving diagnostic sensitivities of 94.11% and 92%, respectively. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architecture with large-scale real-world validation, DepViT-CAD offers a robust and scalable approach for AI-assisted cancer diagnostics.

| **[Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08178v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/MIL-JigsawPuzzles.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |
| **[UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20653v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</p></details> | preprint |

Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing.</p></details> |  |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |

These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance. To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD) module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF) strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in survival prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLa: Hierarchical Vision-Language Collaboration for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04613v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language (VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment. Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation (CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression.

WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.</p></details> |  |

However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring</p></details> |  |
| **[TICON: A Slide-Level Tile Contextualizer for Histopathology Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21331v2)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench). Finally, we pretrain an aggregator on TICON to form a slide-level foundation model, using only 11K WSIs, outperforming SoTA slide-level foundation models pretrained with up to 350K WSIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[WSD-MIL: Window Scale Decay Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19982v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling.

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeltaMIL: Gated Memory Integration for Efficient and Discriminative Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19331v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are typically analyzed using multiple instance learning (MIL) methods. However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\% with UNI features. These results demonstrate the strong and consistent performance of DeltaMIL across diverse WSI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,7 figures,8 tables</p></details> |

This study investigates the potential of computational pathology to stratify patients using deep learning on routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). We developed and compared three Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks -- CLAM-SB, ABMIL, and ConvNeXt-MIL-XGBoost -- on an in-house dataset of 210 patient cases. The models were trained to predict 5-year recurrence risk, categorized into three tiers (low, medium, high), with ground truth labels established by the 21-gene Recurrence Score. Features were extracted using the UNI and CONCH pre-trained models. In a 5-fold cross-validation, the modified CLAM-SB model demonstrated the strongest performance, achieving a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.836 and a classification accuracy of 76.2%. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning on standard histology slides for automated, genomics-correlated risk stratification, highlighting a promising pathway toward rapid and cost-effective clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[HookMIL: Revisiting Context Modeling in Multiple Instance Learning for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22188v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.</p></details> |  |

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-α, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-α trained with different amounts of data. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.</p></details> | 17 pages |

This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise.

| **[Renal Cell Carcinoma subtyping: learning from multi-resolution localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09471v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renal Cell Carcinoma is typically asymptomatic at the early stages for many patients. This leads to a late diagnosis of the tumor, where the curability likelihood is lower, and makes the mortality rate of Renal Cell Carcinoma high, with respect to its incidence rate. To increase the survival chance, a fast and correct categorization of the tumor subtype is paramount. Nowadays, computerized methods, based on artificial intelligence, represent an interesting opportunity to improve the productivity and the objectivity of the microscopy-based Renal Cell Carcinoma diagnosis. Nonetheless, much of their exploitation is hampered by the paucity of annotated dataset, essential for a proficient training of supervised machine learning technologies. This study sets out to investigate a novel self supervised training strategy for machine learning diagnostic tools, based on the multi-resolution nature of the histological samples. We aim at reducing the need of annotated dataset, without significantly reducing the accuracy of the tool. We demonstrate the classification capability of our tool on a whole slide imaging dataset for Renal Cancer subtyping, and we compare our solution with several state-of-the-art classification counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[IMILIA: interpretable multiple instance learning for inflammation prediction in IBD from H&E whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13440v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, the correct identification of ganglion cells is crucial for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. We introduce a three-stage analysis framework that mimics the pathologist's diagnostic approach. The framework, based on a Vision Transformer model (ViT-B/16), sequentially segments the muscularis propria, segments the myenteric plexus, and detects ganglion cells within anatomically valid regions. 30 whole-slide images of colon tissue were used, each containing manual annotations of muscularis, plexus, and ganglion cells. A 5-fold cross-validation scheme was applied to each stage, along with resolution-specific tiling strategies and tailored postprocessing to ensure anatomical consistency. The proposed method achieved a Dice coefficient of 89.9% and a Plexus Inclusion Rate of 100% for muscularis segmentation. Plexus segmentation reached a recall of 94.8%, a precision of 84.2% and a Ganglia Inclusion Rate of 99.7%. For ganglion cells annotated with high certainty, the model achieved 62.1\% precision and 89.1% recall. When considering all annotated ganglion cells, regardless of certainty level, the overall precision was 67.0%. These results indicate that ViT-based models are effective at leveraging global tissue context and capturing cellular morphology at small scales, even within complex histological tissue structures. This multi-stage methodology has great potential to support digital pathology workflows by reducing inter-observer variability and assisting in the evaluation of Hirschsprung disease. The clinical impact will be evaluated in future work with larger multi-center datasets and additional expert annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively leveraging multimodal data, particularly digital pathology whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic sequencing, remains a significant challenge due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of these modalities and the need for scalable and interpretable frameworks. Existing diagnostic models typically operate on unimodal data, overlooking critical cross-modal interactions that can yield richer clinical insights. We introduce MarbliX (Multimodal Association and Retrieval with Binary Latent Indexed matriX), a self-supervised framework that learns to embed WSIs and immunogenomic profiles into compact, scalable binary codes, termed ``monogram.'' By optimizing a triplet contrastive objective across modalities, MarbliX captures high-resolution patient similarity in a unified latent space, enabling efficient retrieval of clinically relevant cases and facilitating case-based reasoning. \textcolor{black}{In lung cancer, MarbliX achieves 85-89\% across all evaluation metrics, outperforming histopathology (69-71\%) and immunogenomics (73-76\%). In kidney cancer, real-valued monograms yield the strongest performance (F1: 80-83\%, Accuracy: 87-90\%), with binary monograms slightly lower (F1: 78-82\%).</p></details> |  |

Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).</p></details> | <details><summary>Recei...</summary><p>Received Best Paper Award at the 2025 Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2025)</p></details> |

A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.</p></details> | 29 Pages, 10 figures |

Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation. Extensive experiments on five public and one private dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher performance and spatial consistency while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2025</p></details> |

Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs, while requiring significantly lower computation and memory.</p></details> | 20 pages |

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pages...</summary><p>Pages 4, Figures 1, Table 1</p></details> |

Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models designed for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification in computational pathology are rarely evaluated in terms of reliability, leaving a key gap in understanding their suitability for high-stakes applications like clinical decision-making. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing three quantitative metrics for reliability assessment and applying them to several widely used MIL architectures across three region-wise annotated pathology datasets. Our findings indicate that the mean pooling instance (MEAN-POOL-INS)model demonstrates superior reliability compared to other networks, despite its simple architectural design and computational efficiency. These findings underscore the need of reliability evaluation alongside predictive performance in MIL models and establish MEAN-POOL-INS as a strong, trustworthy baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, accepted for oral presentation at SPIE Medical Imaging, 2026</p></details> |
| **[From Correlation to Causation: Max-Pooling-Based Multi-Instance Learning Leads to More Robust Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09449v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In whole slide images (WSIs) analysis, attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) models are susceptible to spurious correlations and degrade under domain shift. These methods may assign high attention weights to non-tumor regions, such as staining biases or artifacts, leading to unreliable tumor region localization. In this paper, we revisit max-pooling-based MIL methods from a causal perspective. Under mild assumptions, our theoretical results demonstrate that max-pooling encourages the model to focus on causal factors while ignoring bias-related factors. Furthermore, we discover that existing max-pooling-based methods may overfit the training set through rote memorization of instance features and fail to learn meaningful patterns. To address these issues, we propose FocusMIL, which couples max-pooling with an instance-level variational information bottleneck (VIB) to learn compact, predictive latent representations, and employs a multi-bag mini-batch scheme to stabilize optimization. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets and one semi-synthetic dataset. The results show that, by capturing causal factors, FocusMIL exhibits significant advantages in out-of-distribution scenarios and instance-level tumor region localization tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[OnSight Pathology: A real-time platform-agnostic computational pathology companion for histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04187v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The microscopic examination of surgical tissue remains a cornerstone of disease classification but relies on subjective interpretations and access to highly specialized experts, which can compromise accuracy and clinical care. While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.</p></details> |  |

Publicly available histopathology datasets remain scarce, and those that do exist predominantly represent Western populations. Consequently, the generalizability of AI models to populations from less digitized regions, such as the Middle East, is largely unknown. This motivates the public release of our dataset to support the development and validation of pathology AI models across globally diverse populations. We present 339 whole-slide images of prostate core needle biopsies from a consecutive series of 185 patients collected in Erbil, Iraq. The slides are associated with Gleason scores and International Society of Urological Pathology grades assigned independently by three pathologists. Scanning was performed using two high-throughput scanners (Leica and Hamamatsu) and one compact scanner (Grundium). All slides were de-identified and are provided in their native formats without further conversion. The dataset enables grading concordance analyses, color normalization, and cross-scanner robustness evaluations. Data will be deposited in the Bioimage Archive (BIA) under accession code: to be announced (TBA), and released under a CC BY 4.0 license.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Self-supervised and vision-language models have been shown to effectively mine large pathology datasets to learn discriminative representations. On the other hand, there are unique problems in pathology, such as annotated data scarcity, privacy regulations in data sharing, and inherently generative tasks like virtual staining. Generative models, capable of synthesizing realistic and diverse images, present a compelling solution to address these problems through image synthesis. We introduce PixCell, the first generative foundation model for histopathology images. PixCell is a diffusion model trained on PanCan-30M, a large, diverse dataset derived from 69,184 H&E-stained whole slide images of various cancer types. We employ a progressive training strategy and a self-supervision-based conditioning that allows us to scale up training without any human-annotated data. By conditioning on real slides, the synthetic images capture the properties of the real data and can be used as data augmentation for small-scale datasets to boost classification performance. We prove the foundational versatility of PixCell by applying it to two generative downstream tasks: privacy-preserving synthetic data generation and virtual IHC staining. PixCell's high-fidelity conditional generation enables institutions to use their private data to synthesize highly realistic, site-specific surrogate images that can be shared in place of raw patient data. Furthermore, using datasets of roughly paired H&E-IHC tiles, we learn to translate PixCell's conditioning from H&E to multiple IHC stains, allowing the generation of IHC images from H&E inputs. Our trained models are publicly released to accelerate research in computational pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page - https://histodiffusion.github.io/docs/projects/pixcell</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting Data Challenges of Computational Pathology: A Pack-based Multiple Instance Learning Training Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20923v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

| **[Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13482v4)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm in which each cancer corresponds to a single model. However, this paradigm naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot leverage knowledge from other cancers. While multi-task learning frameworks have been explored recently, they often place high demands on computational resources and require extensive training on ultra-large, multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper shifts the paradigm to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It comprises three major parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors). (2) Beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmarking, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism behind transferability. (3) We further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. CROPKT could serve as an inception that lays the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

| **[Domain-Specific Foundation Model Improves AI-Based Analysis of Neuropathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05993v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have transformed computational pathology by providing generalizable representations from large-scale histology datasets. However, existing models are predominantly trained on surgical pathology data, which is enriched for non-nervous tissue and overrepresents neoplastic, inflammatory, metabolic, and other non-neurological diseases. Neuropathology represents a markedly different domain of histopathology, characterized by unique cell types (neurons, glia, etc.), distinct cytoarchitecture, and disease-specific pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, and pattern-specific neurodegeneration. This domain mismatch may limit the ability of general-purpose foundation models to capture the morphological patterns critical for interpreting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar ataxias. To address this gap, we developed NeuroFM, a foundation model trained specifically on whole-slide images of brain tissue spanning diverse neurodegenerative pathologies. NeuroFM demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose models across multiple neuropathology-specific downstream tasks, including mixed dementia disease classification, hippocampal region segmentation, and neurodegenerative ataxia identification encompassing cerebellar essential tremor and spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes. This work establishes that domain-specialized foundation models trained on brain tissue can better capture neuropathology-specific features than models trained on general surgical pathology datasets. By tailoring foundation models to the unique morphological landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, NeuroFM enables more accurate and reliable AI-based analysis for brain disease diagnosis and research, setting a precedent for domain-specific model development in specialized areas of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous labeling of surgical resection margins using a foundation model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22131v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.</p></details> | 20 Pages, 5 Figures |
| **[Histomorphology-Guided Prototypical Multi-Instance Learning for Breast Cancer WSI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17983v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histomorphology is crucial in cancer diagnosis. However, existing whole slide image (WSI) classification methods struggle to effectively incorporate histomorphology information, limiting their ability to capture key pathological features. Particularly when the number of instances within a bag is large and their features are complex, it becomes challenging to accurately identify instances decisive for the bag label, making these methods prone to interference from ambiguous instances. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Histomorphology-Guided Prototypical Multi-Instance Learning (HGPMIL) framework that explicitly learns histomorphology-guided prototypical representations by incorporating tumor cellularity, cellular morphology, and tissue architecture. Specifically, our approach consists of three key components: (1) estimating the importance of tumor-related histomorphology information at patch-level based on medical prior knowledge; (2) generating representative prototypes through histomorphology-prototypical clustering; and (3) enabling WSI classification through histomorphology-guided prototypical aggregation. HGPMIL adjusts the decision boundary by incorporating histomorphological importance to reduce instance label uncertainty, thereby reversely optimizing the bag-level boundary. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving high diagnostic accuracy for molecular subtyping, cancer subtyping and survival analysis. The code will be made available at https://github.com/Badgewho/HMDMIL.</p></details> | 11 pages,8 figures |

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

| **[PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

While traditional histopathological assessment remains the standard, deep learning offers a promising path toward objective and automated analysis of whole slide images.

We propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework CORE for accurate nuclei-level registration across diverse multimodal whole-slide image (WSI) datasets. The coarse registration stage leverages prompt-based tissue mask extraction to effectively filter out artefacts and non-tissue regions, followed by global alignment using tissue morphology and ac- celerated dense feature matching with a pre-trained feature extractor. From the coarsely aligned slides, nuclei centroids are detected and subjected to fine-grained rigid registration using a custom, shape-aware point-set registration model. Finally, non-rigid alignment at the cellular level is achieved by estimating a non-linear dis- placement field using Coherent Point Drift (CPD). Our approach benefits from automatically generated nuclei that enhance the accuracy of deformable registra- tion and ensure precise nuclei-level correspondence across modalities. The pro- posed model is evaluated on three publicly available WSI registration datasets, and two private datasets. We show that CORE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalisability, precision, and robustness in bright-field and immunofluorescence microscopy WSIs</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-Adapting Gated Experts: Dynamic Expert Routing for Colonoscopic Lesion Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18493v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial diversity in cell scale and form remains a primary challenge in computer-aided cancer detection on gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs), attributable to cellular heterogeneity. Existing CNN-Transformer hybrids rely on static computation graphs with fixed routing, which consequently causes redundant computation and limits their adaptability to input variability. We propose Shape-Adapting Gated Experts (SAGE), an input-adaptive framework that enables dynamic expert routing in heterogeneous visual networks. SAGE reconfigures static backbones into dynamically routed expert architectures. SAGE's dual-path design features a backbone stream that preserves representation and selectively activates an expert path through hierarchical gating. This gating mechanism operates at multiple hierarchical levels, performing a two-level, hierarchical selection between shared and specialized experts to modulate model logits for Top-K activation. Our Shape-Adapting Hub (SA-Hub) harmonizes structural and semantic representations across the CNN and the Transformer module, effectively bridging diverse modules. Embodied as SAGE-UNet, our model achieves superior segmentation on three medical benchmarks: EBHI, DigestPath, and GlaS, yielding state-of-the-art Dice Scores of 95.57%, 95.16%, and 94.17%, respectively, and robustly generalizes across domains by adaptively balancing local refinement and global context. SAGE provides a scalable foundation for dynamic expert routing, enabling flexible visual reasoning.</p></details> |  |

We use this tool to interface with and evaluate two state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models, CONCH and MUSK, on the task of histological grading in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a critical criterion that informs cSCC staging and patient management. Using a cohort of 440 cSCC H&E WSIs, we benchmark multiple adaptation strategies, demonstrating trade-offs across prediction approaches and validating the potential of using foundation model embeddings to train small specialist models. These findings underscore the promise of pathology foundation models for real-world clinical applications, with PathFMTools enabling efficient analysis and validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 5th Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Gigapixel Pathology Images with Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19652v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being widely used to support clinical care, general-purpose large multimodal models (LMMs) have generally shown poor or inconclusive performance in medical image interpretation, particularly in pathology, where gigapixel images are used. However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%). Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current foundation models and ground future development of LMMs for expert reasoning in pathology.</p></details> |  |

Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference manuscript accepted for oral presentation at CASEIB 2025</p></details> |

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2026</p></details> |

It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Oral, extended version</p></details> |
| **[PathAgent: Toward Interpretable Analysis of Whole-slide Pathology Images via Large Language Model-based Agentic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17052v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) requires an iterative, evidence-driven reasoning process that parallels how pathologists dynamically zoom, refocus, and self-correct while collecting the evidence. However, existing computational pipelines often lack this explicit reasoning trajectory, resulting in inherently opaque and unjustifiable predictions. To bridge this gap, we present PathAgent, a training-free, large language model (LLM)-based agent framework that emulates the reflective, stepwise analytical approach of human experts. PathAgent can autonomously explore WSI, iteratively and precisely locating significant micro-regions using the Navigator module, extracting morphology visual cues using the Perceptor, and integrating these findings into the continuously evolving natural language trajectories in the Executor. The entire sequence of observations and decisions forms an explicit chain-of-thought, yielding fully interpretable predictions. Evaluated across five challenging datasets, PathAgent exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, surpassing task-specific baselines in both open-ended and constrained visual question-answering tasks. Moreover, a collaborative evaluation with human pathologists confirms PathAgent's promise as a transparent and clinically grounded diagnostic assistant.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Recent advances in the pathology foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level multi-scale features from WSIs. However, current pathology FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantages of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of multi-scale heterogeneous pathology FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on diverse datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

The framework consists of four key stages designed to capture prognostic and morphological heterogeneity. First, a Quantile Based Patch Filtering module selects prognostically informative tissue regions through quantile thresholding. Second, Graph Regularized Patch Clustering models phenotype level variations using a k nearest neighbor graph that enforces spatial and morphological coherence. Third, Hierarchical Feature Aggregation learns both intra and inter cluster dependencies to represent multiscale tumor organization. Finally, an Expert Guided Mixture Density Model estimates complex survival distributions via Gaussian mixtures, enabling fine grained risk prediction. Evaluated on TCGA LUAD, TCGA KIRC, and TCGA BRCA cohorts, our model achieves concordance indices of 0.653 ,0.719 ,and 0.733 respectively, surpassing existing state of the art approaches in survival prediction from WSIs.</p></details> |  |

Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) with Vision Transformer backbones have recently shown strong potential for histopathology representation learning. However, conventional random patch sampling during MAE pretraining often includes irrelevant or noisy regions, limiting the model's ability to capture meaningful tissue patterns. In this paper, we present a lightweight and domain-adapted framework that brings structure and biological relevance into MAE-based learning through a wavelet-informed patch selection strategy. WISE-MAE applies a two-step coarse-to-fine process: wavelet-based screening at low magnification to locate structurally rich regions, followed by high-resolution extraction for detailed modeling. This approach mirrors the diagnostic workflow of pathologists and improves the quality of learned representations. Evaluations across multiple cancer datasets, including lung, renal, and colorectal tissues, show that WISE-MAE achieves competitive representation quality and downstream classification performance while maintaining efficiency under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

While computational methods predict gene expression from H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs), existing approaches often fail to capture the intricate biological heterogeneity within spots and are susceptible to morphological noise when integrating contextual information from surrounding tissue. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiFusion, a novel deep learning framework that integrates two complementary components. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Intra-Spot Modeling module that extracts fine-grained morphological representations through multi-resolution sub-patch decomposition, guided by a feature alignment loss to ensure semantic consistency across scales. Concurrently, we present the Context-aware Cross-scale Fusion module, which employs cross-attention to selectively incorporate biologically relevant regional context, thereby enhancing representational capacity. This architecture enables comprehensive modeling of both cellular-level features and tissue microenvironmental cues, which are essential for accurate gene expression prediction. Extensive experiments on two benchmark ST datasets demonstrate that HiFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across both 2D slide-wise cross-validation and more challenging 3D sample-specific scenarios. These results underscore HiFusion's potential as a robust, accurate, and scalable solution for ST inference from routine histopathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026. 7 pages (main text), 12 pages total including references and supplementary material. 6 figures</p></details> |

The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

We propose CellGenNet, a knowledge distillation framework for robust cross-tissue cell segmentation under limited supervision. CellGenNet adopts a student-teacher architecture, where a capacity teacher is trained on sparse annotations and generates soft pseudo-labels for unlabeled regions. The student is optimized using a joint objective that integrates ground-truth labels, teacher-derived probabilistic targets, and a hybrid loss function combining binary cross-entropy and Tversky loss, enabling asymmetric penalties to mitigate class imbalance and better preserve minority nuclear structures. Consistency regularization and layerwise dropout further stabilize feature representations and promote reliable feature transfer. Experiments across diverse cancer tissue WSIs show that CellGenNet improves segmentation accuracy and generalization over supervised and semi-supervised baselines, supporting scalable and reproducible histopathology analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to IEEE SSIAI 2026</p></details> |

Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction. It further demonstrated strong cross-model generalization, reliable uncertainty quantification, and robust survival stratification in multiple external cohorts. In conclusion, nnMIL offers a practical and generalizable solution for translating pathology foundation models into clinically meaningful predictions, advancing the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/Luoxd1996/nnMIL)</p></details> |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted in MICCAI Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02760v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce MergeSlide, a simple yet effective framework that treats lifelong learning as a model merging problem by leveraging a vision-language pathology foundation model. When a new task arrives, it is: 1) defined with class-aware prompts, 2) fine-tuned for a few epochs using an MLP-free backbone, and 3) merged into a unified model using an orthogonal continual merging strategy that preserves performance and mitigates catastrophic forgetting. For inference under the class-incremental learning (CLASS-IL) setting, where task identity is unknown, we introduce Task-to-Class Prompt-aligned (TCP) inference. Specifically, TCP first identifies the most relevant task using task-level prompts and then applies the corresponding class-aware prompts to generate predictions. To evaluate MergeSlide, we conduct experiments on a stream of six TCGA datasets. The results show that MergeSlide outperforms both rehearsal-based continual learning and vision-language zero-shot baselines.

We introduce a comprehensive computational pathology framework that addresses these limitations through four complementary innovations: (1) Quantile-Gated Patch Selection for dynamically identifying prognostically relevant regions, (2) Graph-Guided Clustering to group patches by spatial and morphological similarity, (3) Hierarchical Context Attention to model both local tissue interactions and global slide-level context, and (4) an Expert-Driven Mixture of Log-Logistics module that flexibly models complex survival distributions. Across large TCGA cohorts, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding time-dependent concordance indices of 0.644 on LUAD, 0.751 on KIRC, and 0.752 on BRCA, consistently outperforming both histology-only and multimodal baselines. The framework further provides improved calibration and interpretability, advancing the use of WSIs for personalized cancer prognosis.</p></details> |  |

Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering them computationally infeasible to analyze entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches to achieve reliable diagnoses. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features. Model implementation is available at: https://github.com/coglabiisc/SASHA.</p></details> |  |

However, manual examination of cytology whole slide images (WSIs) is slow, subjective, and depends heavily on expert pathologists. To address this, we introduce the first weakly supervised deep learning framework for patient-level diagnosis of oral cytology whole slide images, leveraging the newly released Oral Cytology Dataset [1], which provides annotated cytology WSIs from ten medical centres across India. Each patient case is represented as a bag of cytology patches and assigned a diagnosis label (Healthy, Benign, Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMD), OSCC) by an in-house expert pathologist. These patient-level weak labels form a new extension to the dataset. We evaluate a baseline multiple-instance learning (MIL) model and a proposed Region-Affinity Attention MIL (RAA-MIL) that models spatial relationships between regions within each slide. The RAA-MIL achieves an average accuracy of 72.7%, weighted F1-score of 0.69 on an unseen test set, outperforming the baseline. This study establishes the first patient-level weakly supervised benchmark for oral cytology and moves toward reliable AI-assisted digital pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at IEEE ISBI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology.

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConSurv outperforms competing methods across multiple metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures.

| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan to restore a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward scan and executes it in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs) and show that it constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. Under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. Our method also boosts the accuracy of four SOTA Mamba models, namely VMamba, LocalVim, PlainMamba and Adventurer, by 0.5% to 3.4%. We integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) model, MambaMIL, which is unidirectional. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space. We conduct few-shot classification and explainability experiments on three distinct cancer datasets, and the results demonstrate the superior generalization capabilities of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |

Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and morphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their gigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and analysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain normalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by fragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight, open-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI preprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation management, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with modern pathology foundation models. By unifying these processes, it streamlines WSI preprocessing, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates the generation of AI-ready datasets, enabling researchers to focus on model development and downstream analysis.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then, additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank. The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the proposed DRE-SLCL method.</p></details> | <details><summary>8page...</summary><p>8pages, 3figures, published to ACM Digital Library</p></details> |

However, existing public CRC datasets often lack morphologic diversity, suffer from class imbalance, and contain low-quality image tiles, limiting model performance and generalizability. To address these issues, we introduce STARC-9 (STAnford coloRectal Cancer), a large-scale dataset for multi-class tissue classification. STARC-9 contains 630,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained image tiles uniformly sampled across nine clinically relevant tissue classes (70,000 tiles per class) from 200 CRC patients at the Stanford University School of Medicine. The dataset was built using a novel framework, DeepCluster++, designed to ensure intra-class diversity and reduce manual curation. First, an encoder from a histopathology-specific autoencoder extracts feature vectors from tiles within each whole-slide image. Then, K-means clustering groups morphologically similar tiles, followed by equal-frequency binning to sample diverse morphologic patterns within each class. The selected tiles are subsequently verified by expert gastrointestinal pathologists to ensure accuracy. This semi-automated process significantly reduces manual effort while producing high-quality, diverse tiles. To evaluate STARC-9, we benchmarked convolutional neural networks, transformers, and pathology-specific foundation models on multi-class CRC tissue classification and segmentation tasks, showing superior generalizability compared to models trained on existing datasets. Although we demonstrate the utility of DeepCluster++ on CRC as a pilot use-case, it is a flexible framework that can be used for constructing high-quality datasets from large WSI repositories across a wide range of cancer and non-cancer applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 18 figures, Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Building Trust in Virtual Immunohistochemistry: Automated Assessment of Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04615v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models can generate virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images, offering a scalable and low-cost alternative to laboratory IHC. However, reliable evaluation of image quality remains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify image fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an automated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across sixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution, we generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by each virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to compute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly quantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual annotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics, including Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and pathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE achieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based models are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels. Moreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are invisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level benchmarks. Together, this framework defines a reproducible approach for assessing the quality of virtual IHC models, a critical step to accelerate translation towards routine use by pathologists.</p></details> |  |

However, spatial, semantic, and decision entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling. Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent decision-making process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/Prince-Lee-PathAI/PG-CIDL</p></details> |

Comprehensive datasets that combine histopathological images with genetic and survival data across various tumour sites are essential for advancing computational pathology and personalised medicine. We present SurGen, a dataset comprising 1,020 H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) from 843 colorectal cancer cases. The dataset includes detailed annotations for key genetic mutations (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF) and mismatch repair status, as well as survival data for 426 cases. We illustrate SurGen's utility with a proof-of-concept model that predicts mismatch repair status directly from WSIs, achieving a test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8273. These preliminary results underscore the dataset's potential to facilitate research in biomarker discovery, prognostic modelling, and advanced machine learning applications in colorectal cancer and beyond. SurGen offers a valuable resource for the scientific community, enabling studies that require high-quality WSIs linked with comprehensive clinical and genetic information on colorectal cancer. Our initial findings affirm the dataset's capacity to advance diagnostic precision and foster the development of personalised treatment strategies in colorectal oncology.

| **[PRISM2: Unlocking Multi-Modal General Pathology AI with Clinical Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13063v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rapid progress in the field of computational pathology has been enabled by foundation models. These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |

Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both pathologists and AI systems that might support human experts.

These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.</p></details> | 52 pages, 34 figures |
| **[Accurate and Scalable Multimodal Pathology Retrieval via Attentive Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23224v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, static hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) file servers cannot natively stream subregions of high-resolution image files, such as the IFE. The majority of contemporary WSI viewer systems are designed as browser-based web applications and leverage OpenSeaDragon as the tile-based rendering framework. These systems convert WSI files to Deep Zoom Images (DZI) for compatibility with simple static HTTP file servers. To address this limitation, we have developed the Iris RESTful Server, a low-overhead HTTP server with a RESTful API that is natively compatible with the DICOMweb WADO-RS API. Written in C++ with Boost Beast HTTP and Asio networking libraries atop the public IFE libraries, the server offers both security and high performance. Testing shows that a single Raspberry Pi equivalent system can handle a peak of 5,061 req/s (average 3,883 req/s) with a median latency of 21 ms on a private (i.e. hospital) network. We also developed and merged a new OpenSeaDragon TileSource, compatible with the Iris RESTful API, into the next OpenSeaDragon release, enabling simple and immediate drop-in replacement of DZI images within WSI viewer stacks. Designed as a secure cross-origin resource sharing microservice, this architecture includes detailed deployment instructions for new or existing WSI workflows, and the public examples.restful.irisdigitalpathology.org subdomain is provided as a development tool to accelerate WSI web viewer development.

This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models, UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate, false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability. This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in slide-level representation learning.</p></details> |  |

We built a pipeline to apply previously validated segmentation models of kidney structures and extract quantitative features from these structures. Such quantitative analysis also requires qualitative inspection of results for quality control, exploration, and communication. We extend the Vitessce web-based visualization tool to enable visualization of segmentations of multiple types of functional tissue units, such as, glomeruli, tubules, arteries/arterioles in the kidney. Moreover, we propose a standard representation for files containing multiple segmentation bitmasks, which we define polymorphically, such that existing formats including OME-TIFF, OME-NGFF, AnnData, MuData, and SpatialData can be used. We demonstrate that these methods enable researchers and the broader public to interactively explore datasets containing multiple segmented entities and associated features, including for exploration of renal morphometry of biopsies from the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Flow Model with Low-Rank Transformers for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21829v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete modalities scenario.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we assume for each instance a random location. Then, conditional on this random location, we assume for the feature vector a standard Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The proposed SGMM allows the mixing probability to be nonparametrically related to the spatial location. Compared with a classical GMM, SGMM is considerably more flexible and allows the instances from the same class to be spatially clustered. To estimate the SGMM, novel EM algorithms are developed and rigorous asymptotic theories are established. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate our finite sample performance. For a real application, we apply our SGMM method to the CAMELYON16 dataset of whole-slide images (WSIs) for breast cancer detection. The SGMM method demonstrates outstanding clustering performance.</p></details> |  |

However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights.

The recent advancement of foundation models in computational pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens of 424 patients with stage III CRC.

| **[SPADE: Spatial Transcriptomics and Pathology Alignment Using a Mixture of Data Experts for an Expressive Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21857v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalisation of automatic tumour segmentation in histopathological whole-slide images across multiple cancer types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11182v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06113v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.</p></details> | 12 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A Hierarchical Geometry-guided Transformer for Histological Subtyping of Primary Liver Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05657v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, accepted by IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11846v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 μm on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 μm) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientMIL: Efficient Linear-Complexity MIL Method for WSI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23640v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.</p></details> | Submitted to Array |

However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our d...</summary><p>Our dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/records/16812932 , our code is available at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/beetle , and our benchmark is available at https://beetle.grand-challenge.org/</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic and Visual Crop-Guided Diffusion Models for Heterogeneous Tissue Synthesis in Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17847v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities (\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning (\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot pathology diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods in WSI survival analysis struggle with limited interpretability and often overlook predictive uncertainty in heterogeneous slide images. In this paper, we propose DPsurv, a dual-prototype whole-slide image evidential fusion network that outputs uncertainty-aware survival intervals, while enabling interpretation of predictions through patch prototype assignment maps, component prototypes, and component-wise relative risk aggregation. Experiments on five publicly available datasets achieve the highest mean concordance index and the lowest mean integrated Brier score, validating the effectiveness and reliability of DPsurv. The interpretation of prediction results provides transparency at the feature, reasoning, and decision levels, thereby enhancing the trustworthiness and interpretability of DPsurv.</p></details> |  |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with >92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhengwang9/Rasa.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCORPION: Addressing Scanner-Induced Variability in Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20907v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in UNSURE 2025 workshop in MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/MHIM-MIL.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Cluster-Level Sparse Multi-Instance Learning for Whole-Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11034v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) is pivotal for analyzing complex, weakly labeled datasets, such as whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology, where bags comprise unordered collections of instances with sparse diagnostic relevance. Traditional MIL approaches, including early statistical methods and recent attention-based frameworks, struggle with instance redundancy and lack explicit mechanisms for discarding non-informative instances, limiting their robustness and interpretability. We propose Cluster-level Sparse MIL (csMIL), a novel framework that integrates global-local instance clustering, within-cluster attention, and cluster-level sparsity induction to address these challenges. Our csMIL first performs global clustering across all bags to establish $K$ cluster centers, followed by local clustering within each bag to assign cluster labels. Attention scores are computed within each cluster, and sparse regularization is applied to cluster weights, enabling the selective retention of diagnostically relevant clusters while discarding irrelevant ones. This approach enhances robustness to noisy instances, improves interpretability by identifying critical regions, and reduces computational complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that csMIL requires $O(s log K)$ bags to recover $s$ relevant clusters, aligning with compressed sensing principles. Empirically, csMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public histopathology benchmarks (CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC).</p></details> | 12 pages,5 figures |

However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue) interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs, comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training, validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023 challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted manuscript of an article published in Medical Image Analysis (Elsevier).

However, existing open-source tools are often distributed as source code or Docker containers, requiring advanced programming skills that hinder accessibility for non-programmers, such as clinicians. Additionally, current models are typically trained on a single dataset and lack flexibility in adjusting confidence levels for predictions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GloFinder, a QuPath plugin designed for single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs with online editing through the graphical user interface (GUI). GloFinder employs CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework utilizing circle representations for precise object localization, with models trained on approximately 160,000 manually annotated glomeruli. To further enhance accuracy, the plugin incorporates Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF), an ensemble method that combines confidence scores from multiple CircleNet models to produce refined predictions, achieving superior performance in glomerular detection. GloFinder enables direct visualization and editing of results in QuPath, facilitating seamless interaction for clinicians and providing a powerful tool for nephropathology research and clinical practice.

However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT. All codes have been made publicly accessible at https://github.com/Hanminghao/MSCPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE TMI for possible publication</p></details> |

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems. This work aims to provide a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners developing content generation models in computational pathology.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

Despite this progress, there is a lack of labeled datasets and open source pipelines specifically tailored for analysis of skin tissue. Here we propose Histo-Miner, a deep learning-based pipeline for analysis of skin WSIs and generate two datasets with labeled nuclei and tumor regions. We develop our pipeline for the analysis of patient samples of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a frequent non-melanoma skin cancer. Utilizing the two datasets, comprising 47,392 annotated cell nuclei and 144 tumor-segmented WSIs respectively, both from cSCC patients, Histo-Miner employs convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for nucleus segmentation and classification as well as tumor region segmentation. Performance of trained models positively compares to state of the art with multi-class Panoptic Quality (mPQ) of 0.569 for nucleus segmentation, macro-averaged F1 of 0.832 for nucleus classification and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.884 for tumor region segmentation. From these predictions we generate a compact feature vector summarizing tissue morphology and cellular interactions, which can be used for various downstream tasks. Here, we use Histo-Miner to predict cSCC patient response to immunotherapy based on pre-treatment WSIs from 45 patients. Histo-Miner identifies percentages of lymphocytes, the granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio in tumor vicinity and the distances between granulocytes and plasma cells in tumors as predictive features for therapy response. This highlights the applicability of Histo-Miner to clinically relevant scenarios, providing direct interpretation of the classification and insights into the underlying biology.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages including supplement, 5 core figures, 5 supplement figures.

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable and Loosely-Coupled Multimodal Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03408v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records, and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities, making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.</p></details> |  |
| **[MorphGen: Morphology-Guided Representation Learning for Robust Single-Domain Generalization in Histopathological Cancer Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00311v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia, chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks, MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima. Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study, we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from 158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the costs and time associated with drug development.</p></details> |  |

The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

These images can be viewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields, including pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research. They are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology, microbiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic science. When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it is essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently no standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through manual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several million objects. We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a profiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this approach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics to achieve interoperability between different catalogs. Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that provides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is organized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations, with each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes. We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard through specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and graph-based WSI representations.</p></details> |  |

It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies, leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20 anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness.

However, pathology images from different hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features, posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Versatile Pathology Co-pilot via Reasoning Enhanced Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17303v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[HistoViT: Vision Transformer for Accurate and Scalable Histopathological Cancer Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11181v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance, reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99% across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability, and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology. Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens and improve healthcare outcomes.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 Figures |

A good explanation highlights if a model depends on spurious features that undermines generalization and harms a subset of patients or, conversely, may present novel biological insights. Although techniques like GradCAM can identify influential features, they are measurement tools that do not themselves form an explanation. We propose a human-machine-VLM interaction system tailored to explaining classifiers in computational pathology, including multi-instance learning for whole-slide images. Our proof of concept comprises (1) an AI-integrated slide viewer to run sliding-window experiments to test claims of an explanation, and (2) quantification of an explanation's predictiveness using general-purpose vision-language models. The results demonstrate that this allows us to qualitatively test claims of explanations and can quantifiably distinguish competing explanations. This offers a practical path from explainable AI to explained AI in digital pathology and beyond.

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, 38 pages, 22 figures, 35 tables</p></details> |

Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms.

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |
| **[AHDMIL: Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning for Fast and Accurate Whole-Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05114v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need to process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To address this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL comprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which operates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance Pre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution counterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for WSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify irrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation (AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence with patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and efficient inference of DMIN. In addition, we design the first Chebyshev-polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold (CKA) classifier in computational pathology, which improves classification performance through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that AHDMIL consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both classification performance and inference speed. For example, on the Camelyon16 dataset, it achieves a relative improvement of 5.3% in accuracy and accelerates inference by 1.2.times. Across all datasets, area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, f1 score, and brier score show consistent gains, with average inference speedups ranging from 1.2 to 2.1 times.

However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.</p></details> |  |

However, WSI analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data volume.

To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich global contextual understanding.

LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Conventional patch-based methods inevitably distort spatial relationships or treat patches as independent samples, while traditional attention mechanisms, designed for dense, uniformly distributed data, are computationally impractical for WSIs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse-native computational framework that preserves exact spatial relationships, unlocking advanced modeling techniques and bridging a long-standing gap between WSI analysis and general vision. Based on this framework, we develop Sparse Pyramid Attention Networks (SPAN), incorporating a hierarchical sparse pyramid attention architecture with shifted windows that efficiently directs computational resources to informative regions. SPAN comprises two key modules: Spatial-Adaptive Feature Condensation, which progressively builds multi-scale representations from a single-scale input through sparse downsampling, and Context-Aware Feature Refinement, which captures long-range dependencies via shifted windows and global tokens. Evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate SPAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating both our framework's effectiveness and SPAN's specific advantages in capturing contextual and hierachical representations that existing methods fundamentally cannot model. Our work establishes a new paradigm for WSI analysis that overcomes long-standing computational barriers. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |

We developed methods to predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists' attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Medical Image Analysis (MEDIA), Elsevier, 2025.

| **[Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

We systematically reviewed studies combining whole slide images (WSIs) and high-throughput omics to predict overall survival. Searches of EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane CENTRAL (12/08/2024), plus citation screening, identified eligible studies. Data extraction used CHARMS; bias was assessed with PROBAST+AI; synthesis followed SWiM and PRISMA 2020. Protocol: PROSPERO (CRD42024594745). Forty-eight studies (all since 2017) across 19 cancer types met criteria; all used The Cancer Genome Atlas.

Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL).

Despite its success, a critical limitation of current MIL methods lies in the underutilization of pre-training for the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches initialize the aggregator randomly and train it from scratch, making performance highly sensitive to the quantity of labeled WSIs and ignoring the abundance of unlabeled WSIs commonly available in clinical settings. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating PreMix as a plug-in module into HIPT yields an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training sizes and datasets. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

Computational quantification of TIME characteristics, such as cell detection and tissue segmentation, can support biomarker development. However, currently available digital pathology datasets of NSCLC for the development of cell detection or tissue segmentation algorithms are limited in scope, lack annotations of clinically prevalent metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i) multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides, with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection, and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides.

Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |

SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text, 2 page references, 2 page appendix; under submission</p></details> |

While recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models. Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.</p></details> |  |

Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors.

In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (<1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</p></details> | preprint |

Traditional prognostic models, which rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics, often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data, including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA, and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used. These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling inference even when certain modalities are missing.</p></details> |  |

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

Typically relying on weeks of training on large databases, the creation of FMs is a resource-intensive process in many ways. In this paper, we introduce the extension of our supervised foundation model, Tissue Concepts, to whole slide images, called Tissue Concepts v2 (TCv2), a supervised foundation model for whole slide images to address the issue above. TCv2 uses supervised, end-to-end multitask learning on slide-level labels. Training TCv2 uses a fraction of the training resources compared to self-supervised training. The presented model shows superior performance compared to SSL-trained models in cancer subtyping benchmarks and is fully trained on freely available data. Furthermore, a shared trained attention module provides an additional layer of explainability across different tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Automatic Data Curation for Vision Foundation Models in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18709v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization for Histopathological Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02395v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) significantly reduced annotation costs via bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Current methods often employ straightforward fusion strategies for multimodal feature integration, failing to comprehensively capture modality-specific and modality-common interactions, resulting in a limited understanding of multimodal correlations and suboptimal predictive performance. To mitigate these limitations, this paper presents a Multimodal Representation Decoupling Network (MurreNet) to advance cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first propose a Multimodal Representation Decomposition (MRD) module to explicitly decompose paired input data into modality-specific and modality-shared representations, thereby reducing redundancy between modalities. Furthermore, the disentangled representations are further refined then updated through a novel training regularization strategy that imposes constraints on distributional similarity, difference, and representativeness of modality features. Finally, the augmented multimodal features are integrated into a joint representation via proposed Deep Holistic Orthogonal Fusion (DHOF) strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on six TCGA cancer cohorts demonstrate that our MurreNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in survival prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLa: Hierarchical Vision-Language Collaboration for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04613v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer re-search. Despite notable success, existing approaches are limited by their reliance on sparse slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative repre-sentations from gigapixel WSIs. Recently, vision language (VL) models, which incorporate additional language supervision, have emerged as a promising solu-tion. However, VL-based survival prediction remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges. First, current methods often rely on only one simple lan-guage prompt and basic cosine similarity, which fails to learn fine-grained associ-ations between multi-faceted linguistic information and visual features within WSI, resulting in inadequate vision-language alignment. Second, these methods primarily exploit patch-level information, overlooking the intrinsic hierarchy of WSIs and their interactions, causing ineffective modeling of hierarchical interac-tions. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel Hierarchical vision-Language collaboration (HiLa) framework for improved survival prediction. Specifically, HiLa employs pretrained feature extractors to generate hierarchical visual features from WSIs at both patch and region levels. At each level, a series of language prompts describing various survival-related attributes are constructed and aligned with visual features via Optimal Prompt Learning (OPL). This ap-proach enables the comprehensive learning of discriminative visual features cor-responding to different survival-related attributes from prompts, thereby improv-ing vision-language alignment. Furthermore, we introduce two modules, i.e., Cross-Level Propagation (CLP) and Mutual Contrastive Learning (MCL) to maximize hierarchical cooperation by promoting interactions and consistency be-tween patch and region levels. Experiments on three TCGA datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

As an alternative, predicting gene expression from pathology whole slide images (WSI) is gaining increasing attention. However, existing methods typically rely on single patches or a single pathology modality, neglecting the complex spatial and molecular interactions between target and neighboring information (e.g., gene co-expression). This leads to a failure in establishing connections among adjacent regions and capturing intricate cross-modal relationships. To address these issues, we propose NH2ST, a framework that integrates spatial context and both pathology and gene modalities for gene expression prediction. Our model comprises a query branch and a neighbor branch to process paired target patch and gene data and their neighboring regions, where cross-attention and contrastive learning are employed to capture intrinsic associations and ensure alignments between pathology and gene expression. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving over 20% in PCC metrics.

Our investigation reveals the positive correlation between attention entropy and model performance. Building on this insight, we integrate AEM regularization into the MIL framework to penalize excessive attention concentration. To address sensitivity to the AEM weight parameter, we implement Cosine Weight Annealing, reducing parameter dependency.

WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted for publication at Machine Intelligence Research (MIR)</p></details> |

However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.</p></details> |  |

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixel Simulation: Pathology Image Generation via Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and Prototype Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21058v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, understanding and generation have evolved along disparate paths: advanced understanding models already exhibit diagnostic-level competence, whereas generative models largely simulate pixels. Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image. The meticulously curated datasets, complete source code, and pre-trained model weights developed in this study will be made openly accessible to the public.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 17 figures, and 6 tables</p></details> |

A case-based retrieval paradigm offers a more interpretable alternative for clinical adoption. However, current SOTA models are constrained by dual-encoder architectures that cannot process the composed modality of real-world clinical queries. We formally define the task of Pathology Composed Retrieval (PCR). However, progress in this newly defined task is blocked by two critical challenges: (1) Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer the necessary deep-fusion architecture but suffer from a critical Task Mismatch and Domain Mismatch. (2) No benchmark exists to evaluate such compositional queries. To solve these challenges, we propose HOMIE, a systematic framework that transforms a general MLLM into a specialized retrieval expert. HOMIE resolves the dual mismatch via a two-stage process: a retrieval-adaptation stage to solve the task mismatch, and a pathology-specific tuning stage, featuring a progressive knowledge curriculum, pathology specfic stain and native resolution processing, to solve the domain mismatch. We also introduce the PCR Benchmark, a benchmark designed to evaluate composed retrieval in pathology. Experiments show that HOMIE, trained only on public data, matches SOTA performance on traditional retrieval tasks and outperforms all baselines on the newly defined PCR task.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validation of Diagnostic Artificial Intelligence Models for Prostate Pathology in a Middle Eastern Cohort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17499v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the efficiency and accuracy of cancer diagnostics. The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer. Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium). Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner. Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.

However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2024 workshop in Health Intelligence Special Theme on Foundation Models and AI Agents</p></details> |

These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 figures, submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |

This observation begs the question: might there exist a 'holy grail' GC algorithm, as yet undiscovered, guaranteeing both constant-length pause times and that memory is collected promptly upon becoming unreachable? For decades, researchers have understood that such a GC is not always possible, i.e., some pathological behavior is unavoidable when the program can make heap cycles and operates near the memory limit, regardless of the GC algorithm used. However, this understanding has until now been only informal, lacking a rigorous formal proof. This paper complements that informal understanding with a rigorous proof, showing with mathematical certainty that every GC that can implement a realistic mutator-observer interface has some pathological program that forces it to either introduce a long GC pause into program execution or reject an allocation even though there is available space. Hence, language designers must either accept these pathological scenarios and design heuristic approaches that minimize their impact (e.g., generational collection), or restrict programs and environments to a strict subset of the behaviors allowed by our mutator-observer-style interface (e.g., by enforcing a type system that disallows cycles or overprovisioning memory).</p></details> | <details><summary>OOPSL...</summary><p>OOPSLA 2025.

Generative models offer a potential solution but suffer from semantic instability and morphological hallucinations that compromise diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce a Correlation-Regulated Alignment Framework for Tissue Synthesis (CRAFTS), the first generative foundation model for pathology-specific text-to-image synthesis. By leveraging a dual-stage training strategy on approximately 2.8 million image-caption pairs, CRAFTS incorporates a novel alignment mechanism that suppresses semantic drift to ensure biological accuracy. This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering. In addition, coupling CRAFTS with ControlNet enables precise control over tissue architecture from inputs such as nuclear segmentation masks and fluorescence images. By overcoming the critical barriers of data scarcity and privacy concerns, CRAFTS provides a limitless source of diverse, annotated histology data, effectively unlocking the creation of robust diagnostic tools for rare and complex cancer phenotypes.</p></details> | <details><summary>68 pa...</summary><p>68 pages, 9 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

To capture this broader biological landscape, we present EXAONE Path 2.5, a pathology foundation model that jointly models histologic, genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic modalities, producing an integrated patient representation that reflects tumor biology more comprehensively. Our approach incorporates three key components: (1) multimodal SigLIP loss enabling all-pairwise contrastive learning across heterogeneous modalities, (2) a fragment-aware rotary positional encoding (F-RoPE) module that preserves spatial structure and tissue-fragment topology in WSI, and (3) domain-specialized internal foundation models for both WSI and RNA-seq to provide biologically grounded embeddings for robust multimodal alignment. We evaluate EXAONE Path 2.5 against six leading pathology foundation models across two complementary benchmarks: an internal real-world clinical dataset and the Patho-Bench benchmark covering 80 tasks. Our framework demonstrates high data and parameter efficiency, achieving on-par performance with state-of-the-art foundation models on Patho-Bench while exhibiting the highest adaptability in the internal clinical setting. These results highlight the value of biologically informed multimodal design and underscore the potential of integrated genotype-to-phenotype modeling for next-generation precision oncology.</p></details> |  |

The lipid-deficient de-clear cell differentiated (DCCD) ccRCC subtype, defined by multi-omics analyses, is associated with adverse outcomes even in early-stage disease. Here, we establish a hierarchical cross-scale framework for the preoperative identification of DCCD-ccRCC. At the highest layer, cross-modal mapping transferred molecular signatures to histological and CT phenotypes, establishing a molecular-to-pathology-to-radiology supervisory bridge. Within this framework, each modality-specific model is designed to mirror the inherent hierarchical structure of tumor biology. PathoDCCD captured multi-scale microscopic features, from cellular morphology and tissue architecture to meso-regional organization. RadioDCCD integrated complementary macroscopic information by combining whole-tumor and its habitat-subregions radiomics with a 2D maximal-section heterogeneity metric. These nested models enabled integrated molecular subtype prediction and clinical risk stratification. Across five cohorts totaling 1,659 patients, PathoDCCD reliably recapitulated molecular subtypes, while RadioDCCD provided reliable preoperative prediction. The consistent predictions identified patients with the poorest clinical outcomes. This cross-scale paradigm unifies molecular biology, computational pathology, and quantitative radiology into a biologically grounded strategy for preoperative noninvasive molecular phenotyping of ccRCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-driven Fusion of Pathology Foundation Models for Enhanced Disease Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11104v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse pathology tasks. While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.</p></details> | 29 Pages, 10 figures |
| **[Synthetic Vasculature and Pathology Enhance Vision-Language Model Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11060v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path toward interpretable medical diagnosis by allowing users to ask about clinical explanations alongside predictions and across different modalities. However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables.

| **[LoC-Path: Learning to Compress for Pathology Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05391v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) understanding is fundamentally challenging due to its gigapixel scale and the extreme sparsity of diagnostically relevant regions. Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art whole-slide MLLMs, while requiring significantly lower computation and memory.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Towards Robust Assessment of Pathological Voices via Combined Low-Level Descriptors and Foundation Model Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21356v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceptual voice quality assessment plays a vital role in diagnosing and monitoring voice disorders. Traditional methods, such as the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) and the Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain (GRBAS) scales, rely on expert raters and are prone to inter-rater variability, emphasizing the need for objective solutions. This study introduces the Voice Quality Assessment Network (VOQANet), a deep learning framework that employs an attention mechanism and Speech Foundation Model (SFM) embeddings to extract high-level features. To further enhance performance, we propose VOQANet+, which integrates self-supervised SFM embeddings with low-level acoustic descriptors-namely jitter, shimmer, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR). Unlike previous approaches that focus solely on vowel-based phonation (PVQD-A), our models are evaluated on both vowel-level and sentence-level speech (PVQD-S) to assess generalizability. Experimental results demonstrate that sentence-based inputs yield higher accuracy, particularly at the patient level. Overall, VOQANet consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient across CAPE-V and GRBAS dimensions, with VOQANet+ achieving even greater performance gains. Additionally, VOQANet+ maintains consistent performance under noisy conditions, suggesting enhanced robustness for real-world and telehealth applications. This work highlights the value of combining SFM embeddings with low-level features for accurate and robust pathological voice assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[StainNet: A Special Staining Self-Supervised Vision Transformer for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10326v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale histological images have significantly accelerated the development of computational pathology. These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths. We have released the StainNet model weights at: https://huggingface.co/JWonderLand/StainNet.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Unifying Multiple Foundation Models for Advanced Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00736v3)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have advanced computational pathology by learning transferable visual representations from large histological datasets, yet recent evaluations reveal substantial variability in their performance across tasks. This inconsistency arises from differences in training data diversity and is further constrained by the reliance of many high-performing models on proprietary datasets that cannot be shared or expanded. Offline distillation offers a partial remedy but depends heavily on the size and heterogeneity of the distillation corpus and requires full retraining to incorporate new models. To address these limitations, we propose Shazam, a task-specific online integration framework that unifies multiple pretrained pathology foundation models within a single flexible inference system. Shazam fuses multi-level representations through adaptive expert weighting and learns task-aligned features via online distillation. Across spatial transcriptomics prediction, survival prognosis, tile classification, and visual question answering, Shazam consistently outperforms strong individual models, highlighting its promise as a scalable approach for harnessing the rapid evolution of pathology foundation models in a unified and adaptable manner.</p></details> | 37 pages, 5 figures |

Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pages...</summary><p>Pages 4, Figures 1, Table 1</p></details> |

We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies. [Code will be made publicly available].</p></details> |  |

These shortcomings stem not from tuning problems but from deeper conceptual mismatches: dense embeddings cannot represent the combinatorial richness of tissue, and current architectures inherit flaws in self-supervision, patch design, and noise-fragile pretraining. Biological complexity and limited domain innovation further widen the gap. The evidence is clear-pathology requires models explicitly designed for biological images rather than adaptations of large-scale natural-image methods whose assumptions do not hold for tissue.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Medical Visual Representation Learning with Pathological-level Cross-Modal Alignment and Correlation Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10573v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report generation.

Point-wise loss functions have been widely used to minimize the discrepancy between predicted and absolute gene expression values. However, due to the complexity of the sequencing techniques and intrinsic variability across cells, the observed gene expression contains stochastic noise and batch effects, and estimating the absolute expression values accurately remains a significant challenge. To mitigate this, we propose a novel objective of learning relative expression patterns rather than absolute levels. We assume that the relative expression levels of genes exhibit consistent patterns across independent experiments, even when absolute expression values are affected by batch effects and stochastic noise in tissue samples. Based on the assumption, we model the relation and propose a novel loss function called STRank that is robust to noise and batch effects. Experiments using synthetic datasets and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/naivete5656/STRank.</p></details> | Neurips 2025 |
| **[MetaChest: Generalized few-shot learning of pathologies from chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25590v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with significantly reduced resource requirements.</p></details> |  |

While emerging breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promise for automated histological analysis, the growing number of proprietary digital pathology solutions has created barriers to real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings. Together, we highlight how OnSight Pathology can deliver real-time AI inferences across a broad range of pathology pipelines, removing key barriers to the adoption of AI tools in histopathology.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, mixed pathologies are common in neurodegeneration. We introduce the Joint Progression Model (JPM), a probabilistic framework that treats single-disease trajectories as partial rankings and builds a prior over joint progressions. We study several JPM variants (Pairwise, Bradley-Terry, Plackett-Luce, and Mallows) and analyze three properties: (i) calibration -- whether lower model energy predicts smaller distance to the ground truth ordering; (ii) separation -- the degree to which sampled rankings are distinguishable from random permutations; and (iii) sharpness -- the stability of sampled aggregate rankings. All variants are calibrated, and all achieve near-perfect separation; sharpness varies by variant and is well-predicted by simple features of the input partial rankings (number and length of rankings, conflict, and overlap). In synthetic experiments, JPM improves ordering accuracy by roughly 21 percent over a strong EBM baseline (SA-EBM) that treats the joint disease as a single condition. Finally, using NACC, we find that the Mallows variant of JPM and the baseline model (SA-EBM) have results that are more consistent with prior literature on the possible disease progression of the mixed pathology of AD and VaD.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages; Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium 2025</p></details> |

However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

However, paired pathological-healthy data are extremely difficult to obtain, as they rely on pre- and post-treatment imaging, constrained by clinical outcomes and longitudinal data availability. Consequently, most existing brain image generation and editing methods focus on visual quality yet remain domain-specific, treating pathological and healthy image modeling independently. We introduce USB (Unified Synthetic Brain), the first end-to-end framework that unifies bidirectional generation and editing of pathological and healthy brain images. USB models the joint distribution of lesions and brain anatomy through a paired diffusion mechanism and achieves both pathological and healthy image generation. A consistency guidance algorithm further preserves anatomical consistency and lesion correspondence during bidirectional pathology-healthy editing. Extensive experiments on six public brain MRI datasets including healthy controls, stroke, and Alzheimer's patients, demonstrate USB's ability to produce diverse and realistic results. By establishing the first unified benchmark for brain image generation and editing, USB opens opportunities for scalable dataset creation and robust neuroimaging analysis.

Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-Aware Prototype Evolution via LLM-Driven Semantic Disambiguation for Multicenter Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22033v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading plays a critical role in early clinical intervention and vision preservation. Recent explorations predominantly focus on visual lesion feature extraction through data processing and domain decoupling strategies. However, they generally overlook domain-invariant pathological patterns and underutilize the rich contextual knowledge of foundation models, relying solely on visual information, which is insufficient for distinguishing subtle pathological variations. Therefore, we propose integrating fine-grained pathological descriptions to complement prototypes with additional context, thereby resolving ambiguities in borderline cases. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Anchor Prototype Modulation (HAPM) framework to facilitate DR grading. First, we introduce a variance spectrum-driven anchor prototype library that preserves domain-invariant pathological patterns. We further employ a hierarchical differential prompt gating mechanism, dynamically selecting discriminative semantic prompts from both LVLM and LLM sources to address semantic confusion between adjacent DR grades. Finally, we utilize a two-stage prototype modulation strategy that progressively integrates clinical knowledge into visual prototypes through a Pathological Semantic Injector (PSI) and a Discriminative Prototype Enhancer (DPE). Extensive experiments across eight public datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves pathology-guided prototype evolution while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Navigating Gigapixel Pathology Images with Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19652v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite being widely used to support clinical care, general-purpose large multimodal models (LMMs) have generally shown poor or inconclusive performance in medical image interpretation, particularly in pathology, where gigapixel images are used. However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%). Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current foundation models and ground future development of LMMs for expert reasoning in pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Adversarial Learning for Pathological Fidelity in Virtual Staining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18946v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In addition to evaluating tumor morphology using H&E staining, immunohistochemistry is used to assess the presence of specific proteins within the tissue. However, this is a costly and labor-intensive technique, for which virtual staining, as an image-to-image translation task, offers a promising alternative. Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the added value of pretherapeutic MR descriptors in predicting breast cancer pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17158v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials \& Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p<0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes</p></details> |  |
| **[TeamPath: Building MultiModal Pathology Experts with Reasoning AI Copilots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17652v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in AI have introduced several strong models in computational pathology to usher it into the era of multi-modal diagnosis, analysis, and interpretation. However, the current pathology-specific visual language models still lack capacities in making diagnosis with rigorous reasoning paths as well as handling divergent tasks, and thus challenges of building AI Copilots for real scenarios still exist. Here we introduce TeamPath, an AI system powered by reinforcement learning and router-enhanced solutions based on large-scale histopathology multimodal datasets, to work as a virtual assistant for expert-level disease diagnosis, patch-level information summarization, and cross-modality generation to integrate transcriptomic information for the clinical usage. We also collaborate with pathologists from Yale School of Medicine to demonstrate that TeamPath can assist them in working more efficiently by identifying and correcting expert conclusions and reasoning paths. Overall, TeamPath can flexibly choose the best settings according to the needs, and serve as an innovative and reliable system for information communication across different modalities and experts.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Fusion of Multi-scale Heterogeneous Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27237v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathology foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving meaningful patch-level or slide-level multi-scale features from WSIs. However, current pathology FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity caused by diverse private training datasets and different network architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we utilize the features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To fully explore the advantages of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we propose a novel framework for the fusion of multi-scale heterogeneous pathology FMs, called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FuseCPath achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on diverse datasets.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Beyond Diagnosis: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs for Pathology Localization in Chest Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18015v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, but showed improvements when provided examples through few shot prompting. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 5th Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Seizure-NGCLNet: Representation Learning of SEEG Spatial Pathological Patterns for Epileptic Seizure Detection via Node-Graph Dual Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02028v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex spatial connectivity patterns, such as interictal suppression and ictal propagation, complicate accurate drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) seizure detection using stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) and traditional machine learning methods. Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.</p></details> |  |

Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction. It further demonstrated strong cross-model generalization, reliable uncertainty quantification, and robust survival stratification in multiple external cohorts. In conclusion, nnMIL offers a practical and generalizable solution for translating pathology foundation models into clinically meaningful predictions, advancing the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/Luoxd1996/nnMIL)</p></details> |

Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond H&E: Unlocking Pathological Insights with Polarization Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05933v2)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology image analysis is fundamental to digital pathology, with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as the gold standard for diagnostic and prognostic assessments. While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we construct a polarization imaging system and curate a new dataset of over 13,000 paired Polar-H&E images. Visualizations of polarization properties reveal distinctive optical signatures in pathological tissues, underscoring its diagnostic value. Building on this dataset, we propose PolarHE, a dual-modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the latter ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a regular paper at IEEE BIBM 2025</p></details> |

Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI).

| **[Adaptive Diagnostic Reasoning Framework for Pathology with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12008v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI tools in pathology have improved screening throughput, standardized quantification, and revealed prognostic patterns that inform treatment. However, adoption remains limited because most systems still lack the human-readable reasoning needed to audit decisions and prevent errors. We present RECAP-PATH, an interpretable framework that establishes a self-learning paradigm, shifting off-the-shelf multimodal large language models from passive pattern recognition to evidence-linked diagnostic reasoning. At its core is a two-phase learning process that autonomously derives diagnostic criteria: diversification expands pathology-style explanations, while optimization refines them for accuracy. This self-learning approach requires only small labeled sets and no white-box access or weight updates to generate cancer diagnoses. Evaluated on breast and prostate datasets, RECAP-PATH produced rationales aligned with expert assessment and delivered substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy over baselines. By uniting visual understanding with reasoning, RECAP-PATH provides clinically trustworthy AI and demonstrates a generalizable path toward evidence-linked interpretation.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Classification to Cross-Modal Understanding: Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Fine-Grained Renal Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11984v1)** | 2025-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained glomerular subtyping is central to kidney biopsy interpretation, but clinically valuable labels are scarce and difficult to obtain. Existing computational pathology approaches instead tend to evaluate coarse diseased classification under full supervision with image-only models, so it remains unclear how vision-language models (VLMs) should be adapted for clinically meaningful subtyping under data constraints. In this work, we model fine-grained glomerular subtyping as a clinically realistic few-shot problem and systematically evaluate both pathology-specialized and general-purpose vision-language models under this setting. We assess not only classification performance (accuracy, AUC, F1) but also the geometry of the learned representations, examining feature alignment between image and text embeddings and the separability of glomerular subtypes. By jointly analyzing shot count, model architecture and domain knowledge, and adaptation strategy, this study provides guidance for future model selection and training under real clinical data constraints. Our results indicate that pathology-specialized vision-language backbones, when paired with the vanilla fine-tuning, are the most effective starting point. Even with only 4-8 labeled examples per glomeruli subtype, these models begin to capture distinctions and show substantial gains in discrimination and calibration, though additional supervision continues to yield incremental improvements. We also find that the discrimination between positive and negative examples is as important as image-text alignment. Overall, our results show that supervision level and adaptation strategy jointly shape both diagnostic performance and multimodal structure, providing guidance for model selection, adaptation strategies, and annotation investment.</p></details> |  |

While computer vision models have shown potential for objectively evaluating parkinsonian gait, their effectiveness is limited by scarce clinical datasets and the challenge of collecting large and well-labelled data, impacting model accuracy and risk of bias. To address these gaps, we propose GAITGen, a novel framework that generates realistic gait sequences conditioned on specified pathology severity levels. GAITGen employs a Conditional Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder to learn disentangled representations of motion dynamics and pathology-specific factors, coupled with Mask and Residual Transformers for conditioned sequence generation. GAITGen generates realistic, diverse gait sequences across severity levels, enriching datasets and enabling large-scale model training in parkinsonian gait analysis. Experiments on our new PD-GaM (real) dataset demonstrate that GAITGen outperforms adapted state-of-the-art models in both reconstruction fidelity and generation quality, accurately capturing critical pathology-specific gait features. A clinical user study confirms the realism and clinical relevance of our generated sequences. Moreover, incorporating GAITGen-generated data into downstream tasks improves parkinsonian gait severity estimation, highlighting its potential for advancing clinical gait analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE/CVF winter conference on applications of computer vision (WACV 2026)</p></details> |

Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer (PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains. Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying spatial and biological context, including tile classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks, including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Domain Generalization Algorithms in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17063v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have shown immense promise in computational pathology (CPath) tasks, but their performance often suffers when applied to unseen data due to domain shifts. Addressing this requires domain generalization (DG) algorithms. However, a systematic evaluation of DG algorithms in the CPath context is lacking. This study aims to benchmark the effectiveness of 30 DG algorithms on 3 CPath tasks of varying difficulty through 7,560 cross-validation runs. We evaluate these algorithms using a unified and robust platform, incorporating modality-specific techniques and recent advances like pretrained foundation models. Our extensive cross-validation experiments provide insights into the relative performance of various DG strategies. We observe that self-supervised learning and stain augmentation consistently outperform other methods, highlighting the potential of pretrained models and data augmentation. Furthermore, we introduce a new pan-cancer tumor detection dataset (HISTOPANTUM) as a benchmark for future research. This study offers valuable guidance to researchers in selecting appropriate DG approaches for CPath tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoPS: Evolutionary Patch Selection for Whole Slide Image Analysis in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07560v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, the gigapixel scale of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates their division into thousands of smaller patches. Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v2)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |

This paper argues that such confident fabrication, what I call the polite liar, is a structural consequence of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Building on Frankfurt's analysis of bullshit as communicative indifference to truth, I show that this pathology is not deception but structural indifference: a reward architecture that optimizes for perceived sincerity over evidential accuracy. Current alignment methods reward models for being helpful, harmless, and polite, but not for being epistemically grounded. As a result, systems learn to maximize user satisfaction rather than truth, performing conversational fluency as a virtue. I analyze this behavior through the lenses of epistemic virtue theory, speech-act philosophy, and cognitive alignment, showing that RLHF produces agents trained to mimic epistemic confidence without access to epistemic justification. The polite liar thus reveals a deeper alignment tension between linguistic cooperation and epistemic integrity. The paper concludes with an "epistemic alignment" principle: reward justified confidence over perceived fluency.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 tables, Preprint - under review at AI & Society</p></details> |
| **[A multi-modal vision-language model for generalizable annotation-free pathology localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02044v7)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing deep learning models for defining pathology from clinical imaging data rely on expert annotations and lack generalization capabilities in open clinical environments. Here, we present a generalizable vision-language model for Annotation-Free pathology Localization (AFLoc). The core strength of AFLoc is extensive multi-level semantic structure-based contrastive learning, which comprehensively aligns multi-granularity medical concepts with abundant image features to adapt to the diverse expressions of pathologies without the reliance on expert image annotations. We conduct primary experiments on a dataset of 220K pairs of image-report chest X-ray images and perform validation across eight external datasets encompassing 34 types of chest pathologies. The results demonstrate that AFLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both annotation-free localization and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the generalizability of AFLoc on other modalities, including histopathology and retinal fundus images. We show that AFLoc exhibits robust generalization capabilities, even surpassing human benchmarks in localizing five different types of pathological images. These results highlight the potential of AFLoc in reducing annotation requirements and its applicability in complex clinical environments.</p></details> |  |

Digitised whole-slide images (WSIs) capture rich spatial and morphological information vital for understanding disease biology, yet their gigapixel scale and variability pose major challenges for standardisation and analysis. Robust preprocessing, covering tissue detection, tessellation, stain normalisation, and annotation parsing is critical but often limited by fragmented and inconsistent workflows. We present PySlyde, a lightweight, open-source Python toolkit built on OpenSlide to simplify and standardise WSI preprocessing. PySlyde provides an intuitive API for slide loading, annotation management, tissue detection, tiling, and feature extraction, compatible with modern pathology foundation models. By unifying these processes, it streamlines WSI preprocessing, enhances reproducibility, and accelerates the generation of AI-ready datasets, enabling researchers to focus on model development and downstream analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Systematic Evaluation of Preprocessing Techniques for Accurate Image Registration in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04171v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image registration refers to the process of spatially aligning two or more images by mapping them into a common coordinate system, so that corresponding anatomical or tissue structures are matched across images. In digital pathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of information from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting applications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate registration of images from different modalities is an essential step in digital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color transformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset of 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing steps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard, Vahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and denoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method, which first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration in two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance was evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported the median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values (AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based evaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done separately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal images. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest registration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These findings show that applying color transformation before registration improves alignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable analysis in digital pathology.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 Figures |
| **[Comparing Computational Pathology Foundation Models using Representational Similarity Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15482v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology (CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures, whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5% (CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can support their effective development and deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 5th Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Symposium</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Elicitation with Large Language Models for Interpretable Cancer Stage Identification from Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01052v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer staging is critical for patient prognosis and treatment planning, yet extracting pathologic TNM staging from unstructured pathology reports poses a persistent challenge. Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG), employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited annotated data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.</p></details> | 37 pages, 3 figures |
| **[PRISM2: Unlocking Multi-Modal General Pathology AI with Clinical Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13063v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent rapid progress in the field of computational pathology has been enabled by foundation models. These models are beginning to move beyond encoding image patches towards whole-slide understanding but their clinical utility remains limited. In this work, we present PRISM2, a multimodal slide-level foundation model trained on data from 700,000 diagnostic specimen-report pairs, the largest vision (2.3 million whole slide images) and language (14M question-answer pairs) histopathology dataset to date. By learning through clinical-dialogue supervision, PRISM2 aligns histomorphologic features with the language of diagnostic reasoning, producing slide-level representations that support both direct diagnostic question-answering and transferable embeddings for downstream tasks. Without additional training, PRISM2 matches or exceeds the cancer-detection performance of clinical-grade products. This is observed without loss of generality on other tasks, where PRISM2 achieves top performance. Finally, using survival prediction as the example, we show that task-specific finetuning with a large dataset can outperform task-specific models, further improving performance. These results demonstrate how language-supervised pretraining provides a scalable, clinically grounded signal for learning generalizable pathology representations, bridging human diagnostic reasoning and foundation-model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPathAgent: An Agent-based Foundation Model for Interpretable High-Resolution Pathology Image Analysis Mimicking Pathologists' Diagnostic Logic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20510v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology have led to the emergence of numerous foundation models. These models typically rely on general-purpose encoders with multi-instance learning for whole slide image (WSI) classification or apply multimodal approaches to generate reports directly from images. However, these models cannot emulate the diagnostic approach of pathologists, who systematically examine slides at low magnification to obtain an overview before progressively zooming in on suspicious regions to formulate comprehensive diagnoses. Instead, existing models directly output final diagnoses without revealing the underlying reasoning process. To address this gap, we introduce CPathAgent, an innovative agent-based approach that mimics pathologists' diagnostic workflow by autonomously navigating across WSI based on observed visual features, thereby generating substantially more transparent and interpretable diagnostic summaries. To achieve this, we develop a multi-stage training strategy that unifies patch-level, region-level, and WSI-level capabilities within a single model, which is essential for replicating how pathologists understand and reason across diverse image scales. Additionally, we construct PathMMU-HR2, the first expert-validated benchmark for large region analysis. This represents a critical intermediate scale between patches and whole slides, reflecting a key clinical reality where pathologists typically examine several key large regions rather than entire slides at once. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPathAgent consistently outperforms existing approaches across benchmarks at three different image scales, validating the effectiveness of our agent-based diagnostic approach and highlighting a promising direction for computational pathology.</p></details> | 52 pages, 34 figures |

Existing anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue structures, and lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Ano-NAViLa, a Normal and Abnormal pathology knowledge-augmented Vision-Language model for Anomaly detection in pathology images. Ano-NAViLa is built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP. By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and provides interpretability through image-text associations. Evaluated on two lymph node datasets from different organs, Ano-NAViLa achieves the state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection and localization, outperforming competing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025.

| **[Accurate and Scalable Multimodal Pathology Retrieval via Attentive Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23224v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1) mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination, and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence, and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable retrieval solution for digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Multi-branch ConvNeXt Architecture for Identifying Subtle Pathological Features in CT Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09107v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features. This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source Code : https://github.com/Irash-Perera/MedNeXt-Branch</p></details> |
| **[Revisiting End-to-End Learning with Slide-level Supervision in Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02408v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained encoders for offline feature extraction followed by multiple instance learning (MIL) aggregators have become the dominant paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), benefiting cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area.

| **[Inverse Optimal Control of Muscle Force Sharing During Pathological Gait](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17456v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides, possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.</p></details> |  |

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal and Transferable Attacks on Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16660v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.</p></details> | 38 Pages, 8 Figures |

While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04587v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.</p></details> |  |

This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/QuIIL/ViDRiP-LLaVA.</p></details> |  |

While computational pathology has made significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100 retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types, and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in 92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by 35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with 87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial intelligence into routine clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

This study developed and validated the PUGenAIS-9 (Problematic Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Scale-9 items) and examined whether PUGenAIS reflects addiction-like patterns under the Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) framework. Using samples from China and the United States (N = 1,508), we conducted confirmatory factor analysis and identified a robust 31-item structure across nine IGD-based dimensions. We then derived the PUGenAIS-9 by selecting the highest-loading items from each dimension and validated its structure in an independent sample (N = 1,426). Measurement invariance tests confirmed its stability across nationality and gender. Person-centered (latent profile analysis) and variable-centered (network analysis) approaches revealed a 5-10% prevalence rate, a symptom network structure similar to IGD, and predictive factors related to psychological distress and functional impairment. These findings indicate that PUGenAI shares features of the emotionally vulnerable subtype of IGD rather than the competence-based type. These results support using PUGenAIS-9 to identify problematic GenAI use and show the need to rethink digital addiction with an ICD (infrastructures, content, and device) model. This keeps addiction research responsive to new media while avoiding over-pathologizing.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

The number of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) is roughly 20 times fewer than the number of affected children, highlighting a significant gap in children's care and a pressing need for technological support that improves the productivity of SLPs. State-of-the-art multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for supporting SLPs, but their use remains underexplored largely due to a limited understanding of their performance in high-stakes clinical settings. To address this gap, we collaborate with domain experts to develop a taxonomy of real-world use cases of MLMs in speech-language pathologies. Building on this taxonomy, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLM across five core use cases, each containing 1,000 manually annotated data points. This benchmark includes robustness and sensitivity tests under various settings, including background noise, speaker gender, and accent. Our evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art MLMs reveals that no single model consistently outperforms others across all tasks. Notably, we find systematic disparities, with models performing better on male speakers, and observe that chain-of-thought prompting can degrade performance on classification tasks with large label spaces and narrow decision boundaries. Furthermore, we study fine-tuning MLMs on domain-specific data, achieving improvements of over 10\% compared to base models. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of current MLMs for speech-language pathology applications, underscoring the need for further research and targeted development.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Oral Presentation</p></details> |

We also release two evaluation benchmarks, YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of 23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 μm on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 μm) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting and benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal and precision oncology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Corpus Callosum Segmentation in Fetal MRI via Pathology-Informed Domain Randomization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20475v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations. We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the PIPPI Workshop of MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14497v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.</p></details> |  |

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.</p></details> |  |

While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as "Good" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% "Good" predictions and only 0.4% "Bad", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.</p></details> |  |

Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |

In this study, we propose a generalizable deep learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies, offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the contextual importance of local versus global information for different downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve (PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39 \pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm 0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching in the Low-Noise Regime: Pathologies and a Contrastive Remedy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20952v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing a continuous-time formulation for generative modeling and representation learning. Yet, we show that this framework suffers from a fundamental instability in the low-noise regime. As noise levels approach zero, arbitrarily small perturbations in the input can induce large variations in the velocity target, causing the condition number of the learning problem to diverge. This ill-conditioning not only slows optimization but also forces the encoder to reallocate its limited Jacobian capacity toward noise directions, thereby degrading semantic representations. We provide the first theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, which we term the low-noise pathology, establishing its intrinsic link to the structure of the flow matching objective. Building on these insights, we propose Local Contrastive Flow (LCF), a hybrid training protocol that replaces direct velocity regression with contrastive feature alignment at small noise levels, while retaining standard flow matching at moderate and high noise. Empirically, LCF not only improves convergence speed but also stabilizes representation quality. Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing low-noise pathologies to unlock the full potential of flow matching for both generation and representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PS3: A Multimodal Transformer Integrating Pathology Reports with Histology Images and Biological Pathways for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20022v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025. Copyright 2025 IEEE.

While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review: npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, echocardiographic data for certain pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies. Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator, allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity. Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers. Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively.

To address this, we frame pathology detection as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pretraining, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our fully self-supervised model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Furthermore, in a supervised fine-tuning setting, Screener surpasses existing self-supervised pretraining methods, establishing it as a state-of-the-art foundation for pathology segmentation. The code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In addition, we incorporated ConvNeXt V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to complement PFMs. During training, we employed a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving competitive balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-pathology Chest X-ray Classification with Rejection Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10348v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Overconfidence in deep learning models poses a significant risk in high-stakes medical imaging tasks, particularly in multi-label classification of chest X-rays, where multiple co-occurring pathologies must be detected simultaneously. This study introduces an uncertainty-aware framework for chest X-ray diagnosis based on a DenseNet-121 backbone, enhanced with two selective prediction mechanisms: entropy-based rejection and confidence interval-based rejection. Both methods enable the model to abstain from uncertain predictions, improving reliability by deferring ambiguous cases to clinical experts. A quantile-based calibration procedure is employed to tune rejection thresholds using either global or class-specific strategies. Experiments conducted on three large public datasets (PadChest, NIH ChestX-ray14, and MIMIC-CXR) demonstrate that selective rejection improves the trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and coverage, with entropy-based rejection yielding the highest average AUC across all pathologies. These results support the integration of selective prediction into AI-assisted diagnostic workflows, providing a practical step toward safer, uncertainty-aware deployment of deep learning in clinical settings.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining contexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors, introduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in downstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel prompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very first to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our method compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and employs a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on tissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks spanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene expression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs across both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable insights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight AdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced performance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.</p></details> | 6 Tables, 11 Figures |

However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity, controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code, pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |

The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems.

| **[Pathology-Aware Adaptive Watermarking for Text-Driven Medical Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08346v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As recent text-conditioned diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality images, concerns over their potential misuse have also grown. This issue is critical in the medical domain, where text-conditioned generated medical images could enable insurance fraud or falsified records, highlighting the urgent need for reliable safeguards against unethical use. While watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution in general image domains, their direct application to medical imaging presents significant challenges. A key challenge is preserving fine-grained disease manifestations, as even minor distortions from a watermark may lead to clinical misinterpretation, which compromises diagnostic integrity. To overcome this gap, we present MedSign, a deep learning-based watermarking framework specifically designed for text-to-medical image synthesis, which preserves pathologically significant regions by adaptively adjusting watermark strength. Specifically, we generate a pathology localization map using cross-attention between medical text tokens and the diffusion denoising network, aggregating token-wise attention across layers, heads, and time steps. Leveraging this map, we optimize the LDM decoder to incorporate watermarking during image synthesis, ensuring cohesive integration while minimizing interference in diagnostically critical regions. Experimental results show that our MedSign preserves diagnostic integrity while ensuring watermark robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image quality and detection accuracy on MIMIC-CXR and OIA-ODIR datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01071v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable, stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual staining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Pathology and CT Imaging for Personalized Recurrence Risk Prediction in Renal Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21581v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recurrence risk estimation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is essential for guiding postoperative surveillance and treatment. The Leibovich score remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers limited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study evaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed tomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A modular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival modeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion setups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently outperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology. Intermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model (TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random tie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models, suggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using simple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal integration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore more expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and general-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

| **[Are the Majority of Public Computational Notebooks Pathologically Non-Executable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04184v4)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks are the de facto platforms for exploratory data science, offering an interactive programming environment where users can create, modify, and execute code cells in any sequence. However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[PathMR: Multimodal Visual Reasoning for Interpretable Pathology Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20851v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives, these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.</p></details> |  |

Multiple instance learning (MIL) remains an essential next step following foundation model, designing a framework to aggregate patch-level features into slide-level predictions. We present EAGLE-Net, a structure-preserving, attention-guided MIL architecture designed to augment prediction and interpretability. EAGLE-Net integrates multi-scale absolute spatial encoding to capture global tissue architecture, a top-K neighborhood-aware loss to focus attention on local microenvironments, and background suppression loss to minimize false positives. We benchmarked EAGLE-Net on large pan-cancer datasets, including three cancer types for classification (10,260 slides) and seven cancer types for survival prediction (4,172 slides), using three distinct histology foundation backbones (REMEDIES, Uni-V1, Uni2-h). Across tasks, EAGLE-Net achieved up to 3% higher classification accuracy and the top concordance indices in 6 of 7 cancer types, producing smooth, biologically coherent attention maps that aligned with expert annotations and highlighted invasive fronts, necrosis, and immune infiltration. These results position EAGLE-Net as a generalizable, interpretable framework that complements foundation models, enabling improved biomarker discovery, prognostic modeling, and clinical decision support</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 7 main Figures, 8 Extended Data Figures</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Prototype Alignment for Semi-supervised Pathology Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19574v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly due to ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization (e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely on perturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficult to capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complex pathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel segmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a multimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of MPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes and pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing supervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine supervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on unlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into segmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary modeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture (TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained foundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of pathology-relevant features. Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND, EBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, validating its dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling.</p></details> |  |

To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases, and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54), outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0% HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%). CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perceptual Implications of Automatic Anonymization in Pathological Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00409v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic anonymization techniques are essential for ethical sharing of pathological speech data, yet their perceptual consequences remain understudied. We present a comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality across groups (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners showed a non-significant trend toward higher original speech ratings (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference was minimal after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic metrics; intelligibility was linked to perceived quality in original speech but not after anonymization. These findings underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder-specific anonymization strategies that preserve both privacy and perceptual integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology, where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL) foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited. Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features, overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics. We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.</p></details> |  |

While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process, facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Although classical post-processing techniques such as watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and naïve combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows.

This model significantly outperformed the baseline model and a Large Language Model, Mistral 7B, achieving F1_Bertscore 0.98 and overall exact match of 80.61%. This fine-tuning approach demonstrates the potential for scalability that can integrate seamlessly into the molecular tumour board process. Fine-tuning domain-specific models for precision tasks in oncology, may pave the way for more efficient and accurate clinical information extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Latent Space Augmentation for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14588v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However, current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at the region-of-interest (ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI) classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM. Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks. We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology.</p></details> |  |

Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba), SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods, delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation.

However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg, the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 21 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making.

While MRI offers detailed visualization of cervical spine anatomy, manual interpretation remains labor-intensive and prone to error. To address this, we developed an innovative AI-assisted Expert-based Diagnosis System that automates both segmentation and diagnosis of cervical spondylosis using MRI. Leveraging multi-center datasets of cervical MRI images from patients with cervical spondylosis, our system features a pathology-guided segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting key cervical anatomical structures. The segmentation is followed by an expert-based diagnostic framework that automates the calculation of critical clinical indicators. Our segmentation model achieved an impressive average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.90 across four cervical spinal anatomies and demonstrated enhanced accuracy in herniation areas. Diagnostic evaluation further showcased the system's precision, with the lowest mean average errors (MAE) for the C2-C7 Cobb angle and the Maximum Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC) coefficient. In addition, our method delivered high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in herniation localization, K-line status assessment, T2 hyperintensity detection, and Kang grading. Comparative analysis and external validation demonstrate that our system outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark for segmentation and diagnostic tasks for cervical spondylosis.</p></details> |  |

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision.

Traditional methods like laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice pathologies using phonation data. Phonation data from the Saarbrücken Voice Database are analyzed using acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures signal quality. Scale-based features, such as Hölder and Hurst exponents, further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies. The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and improving patient outcomes.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 11 Figures |

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |

Current pathology domain adaptation methods focus on image patches rather than WSI, thus failing to capture global WSI features required in typical clinical scenarios. In this work, we address the challenges of slide-level domain shift by proposing a Hierarchical Adaptation framework for Slide-level Domain-shift (HASD). HASD achieves multi-scale feature consistency and computationally efficient slide-level domain adaptation through two key components: (1) a hierarchical adaptation framework that integrates a Domain-level Alignment Solver for feature alignment, a Slide-level Geometric Invariance Regularization to preserve the morphological structure, and a Patch-level Attention Consistency Regularization to maintain local critical diagnostic cues; and (2) a prototype selection mechanism that reduces computational overhead. We validate our method on two slide-level tasks across five datasets, achieving a 4.1\% AUROC improvement in a Breast Cancer HER2 Grading cohort and a 3.9\% C-index gain in a UCEC survival prediction cohort. Our method provides a practical and reliable slide-level domain adaption solution for pathology institutions, minimizing both computational and annotation costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

These factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases, limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search, enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice diagnosis and visual question answering.

To narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings.

We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC), with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice pathology classification while reducing gender bias through hierarchical modeling of vocal characteristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[$MV_{Hybrid}$: Improving Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction with Hybrid State Space-Vision Transformer Backbone in Pathology Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00383v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone.

| **[Priority-Aware Clinical Pathology Hierarchy Training for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20469v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios. Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with multiple symptoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for oral presentation by The 2nd MICCAI Student Board (MSB) EMERGE Workshop</p></details> |

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, current methods under-utilize shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome this challenge, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |
| **[VLM-CPL: Consensus Pseudo Labels from Vision-Language Models for Annotation-Free Pathological Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15836v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification of pathological images is the basis for automatic cancer diagnosis. Despite that deep learning methods have achieved remarkable performance, they heavily rely on labeled data, demanding extensive human annotation efforts. In this study, we present a novel human annotation-free method by leveraging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Without human annotation, pseudo-labels of the training set are obtained by utilizing the zero-shot inference capabilities of VLM, which may contain a lot of noise due to the domain gap between the pre-training and target datasets. To address this issue, we introduce VLM-CPL, a novel approach that contains two noisy label filtering techniques with a semi-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, we first obtain prompt-based pseudo-labels with uncertainty estimation by zero-shot inference with the VLM using multiple augmented views of an input. Then, by leveraging the feature representation ability of VLM, we obtain feature-based pseudo-labels via sample clustering in the feature space. Prompt-feature consensus is introduced to select reliable samples based on the consensus between the two types of pseudo-labels. We further propose High-confidence Cross Supervision by to learn from samples with reliable pseudo-labels and the remaining unlabeled samples. Additionally, we present an innovative open-set prompting strategy that filters irrelevant patches from whole slides to enhance the quality of selected patches. Experimental results on five public pathological image datasets for patch-level and slide-level classification showed that our method substantially outperformed zero-shot classification by VLMs, and was superior to existing noisy label learning methods. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/VLM-CPL.</p></details> | Accepted at TMI |

Existing methods often struggle to maintain anatomical fidelity while accurately modeling pathological features, frequently relying on priors derived from natural images or inefficient multi-step sampling. In this work, we introduce ViCTr (Vital Consistency Transfer), a novel two-stage framework that combines a rectified flow trajectory with a Tweedie-corrected diffusion process to achieve high-fidelity, pathology-aware image synthesis. First, we pretrain ViCTr on the ATLAS-8k dataset using Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to preserve critical anatomical structures. We then fine-tune the model adversarially with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for precise control over pathology severity. By reformulating Tweedie's formula within a linear trajectory framework, ViCTr supports one-step sampling, reducing inference from 50 steps to just 4, without sacrificing anatomical realism. We evaluate ViCTr on BTCV (CT), AMOS (MRI), and CirrMRI600+ (cirrhosis) datasets. Results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Medical Frechet Inception Distance (MFID) of 17.01 for cirrhosis synthesis 28% lower than existing approaches and improving nnUNet segmentation by +3.8% mDSC when used for data augmentation. Radiologist reviews indicate that ViCTr-generated liver cirrhosis MRIs are clinically indistinguishable from real scans. To our knowledge, ViCTr is the first method to provide fine-grained, pathology-aware MRI synthesis with graded severity control, closing a critical gap in AI-driven medical imaging research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in domain generalization improve model transferability in terms of aggregated performance measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC). However, clinical regulations often require to control the transferability of other metrics, such as prescribed sensitivity levels. We introduce a novel approach to control the sensitivity of whole slide image (WSI) classification models, based on optimal transport and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). Validated across multiple cohorts and tasks, our method enables robust sensitivity control with only a handful of calibration samples, providing a practical solution for reliable deployment of computational pathology systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version.

However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |

Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of 0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of 0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases. Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated, to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values and highlight our model's overall predictive power.

| **[Towards Robust Foundation Models for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17845v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features. Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB, a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate) the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust, representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological information over technical artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.

In this study, we investigated the effect of image blur on deep learning models and introduced a mixture of experts (MoE) strategy that combines predictions from multiple expert models trained on data with varying blur levels. Using H&E-stained WSIs from 2,093 breast cancer patients, we benchmarked performance on grade classification and IHC biomarker prediction with both CNN- (CNN_CLAM and MoE-CNN_CLAM) and Vision Transformer-based (UNI_CLAM and MoE-UNI_CLAM) models. Our results show that baseline models' performance consistently decreased with increasing blur, but expert models trained on blurred tiles and especially our proposed MoE approach substantially improved performance, and outperformed baseline models in a range of simulated scenarios. MoE-CNN_CLAM outperformed the baseline CNN_CLAM under moderate (AUC: 0.868 vs. 0.702) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.890 vs. 0.875). MoE-UNI_CLAM outperformed the baseline UNI_CLAM model in both moderate (AUC: 0.950 vs. 0.928) and mixed blur conditions (AUC: 0.944 vs. 0.931). This MoE method has the potential to enhance the reliability of AI-based pathology models under variable image quality, supporting broader application in both research and clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pathology-Guided Virtual Staining Metric for Evaluation and Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12624v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual staining has emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional histopathological staining techniques, enabling rapid, reagent-free image transformations. However, existing evaluation methods predominantly rely on full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) metrics such as structural similarity, which are originally designed for natural images and often fail to capture pathology-relevant features. Expert pathology reviews have also been used, but they are inherently subjective and time-consuming. In this study, we introduce PaPIS (Pathology-Aware Perceptual Image Similarity), a novel FR-IQA metric specifically tailored for virtual staining evaluation. PaPIS leverages deep learning-based features trained on cell morphology segmentation and incorporates Retinex-inspired feature decomposition to better reflect histological perceptual quality. Comparative experiments demonstrate that PaPIS more accurately aligns with pathology-relevant visual cues and distinguishes subtle cellular structures that traditional and existing perceptual metrics tend to overlook. Furthermore, integrating PaPIS as a guiding loss function in a virtual staining model leads to improved histological fidelity. This work highlights the critical need for pathology-aware evaluation frameworks to advance the development and clinical readiness of virtual staining technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Integrating Pathology Foundation Models and Spatial Transcriptomics for Cellular Decomposition from Histology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07013v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Automatic Data Curation for Vision Foundation Models in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18709v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |

Deep neural networks have the potential to identify ovarian tumors, thereby reducing mortality rates, but limited public datasets hinder its progress. To address this gap, we introduce a vital ovarian tumor pathological recognition dataset called \textbf{ViTaL} that contains \textbf{V}isual, \textbf{T}abular and \textbf{L}inguistic modality data of 496 patients across six pathological categories. The ViTaL dataset comprises three subsets corresponding to different patient data modalities: visual data from 2216 two-dimensional ultrasound images, tabular data from medical examinations of 496 patients, and linguistic data from ultrasound reports of 496 patients. It is insufficient to merely distinguish between benign and malignant ovarian tumors in clinical practice. To enable multi-pathology classification of ovarian tumor, we propose a ViTaL-Net based on the Triplet Hierarchical Offset Attention Mechanism (THOAM) to minimize the loss incurred during feature fusion of multi-modal data. This mechanism could effectively enhance the relevance and complementarity between information from different modalities. ViTaL-Net serves as a benchmark for the task of multi-pathology, multi-modality classification of ovarian tumors. In our comprehensive experiments, the proposed method exhibited satisfactory performance, achieving accuracies exceeding 90\% on the two most common pathological types of ovarian tumor and an overall performance of 85\%.

Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T2-weighted cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are essential for MI risk stratification and prognosis assessment. Although combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful, acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free imaging technique that can visualize both motion and structural abnormalities of the myocardium induced by acute MI. Therefore, we present a new end-to-end deep neural network, referred to as CineMyoPS, to segment myocardial pathologies, \ie scars and edema, solely from cine CMR images. Specifically, CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given the interdependence between these features, we design a consistency loss (resembling the co-training strategy) to facilitate their joint learning. Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate MI-related features across the cardiac cycle, thereby enhancing segmentation accuracy for myocardial pathologies. Experimental results on a multi-center dataset demonstrate that CineMyoPS achieves promising performance in myocardial pathology segmentation, motion estimation, and anatomy segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

Their ability to leverage prior knowledge from massive datasets has streamlined the development of intelligent pathology models. However, we identify several critical and interrelated ethical risks that remain underexplored, yet must be addressed to enable the safe translation of PFMs from lab to clinic. These include the potential leakage of patient-sensitive attributes, disparities in model performance across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the reliance on diagnosis-irrelevant features that undermine clinical reliability. In this study, we pioneer the quantitative analysis for ethical risks in PFMs, including privacy leakage, clinical reliability, and group fairness. Specifically, we propose an evaluation framework that systematically measures key dimensions of ethical concern: the degree to which patient-sensitive attributes can be inferred from model representations, the extent of performance disparities across demographic and institutional subgroups, and the influence of diagnostically irrelevant features on model decisions. We further investigate the underlying causes of these ethical risks in PFMs and empirically validate our findings. Then we offer insights into potential directions for mitigating such risks, aiming to inform the development of more ethically robust PFMs. This work provides the first quantitative and systematic evaluation of ethical risks in PFMs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for ethical safeguards in PFMs and offer actionable insights for building more trustworthy and clinically robust PFMs. To facilitate future research and deployment, we will release the assessment framework as an online toolkit to support the development, auditing, and deployment of ethically robust PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages,5 figure,23 tables</p></details> |

Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

While deep learning-based computational pathology has achieved notable success, traditional models primarily focus on image analysis without integrating natural language instruction or rich, text-based context. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in computational pathology face limitations, including insufficient training data, inadequate support and evaluation for multi-image understanding, and a lack of autonomous, diagnostic reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce PathChat+, a new MLLM specifically designed for human pathology, trained on over 1 million diverse, pathology-specific instruction samples and nearly 5.5 million question answer turns. Extensive evaluations across diverse pathology benchmarks demonstrated that PathChat+ substantially outperforms the prior PathChat copilot, as well as both state-of-the-art (SOTA) general-purpose and other pathology-specific models. Furthermore, we present SlideSeek, a reasoning-enabled multi-agent AI system leveraging PathChat+ to autonomously evaluate gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) through iterative, hierarchical diagnostic reasoning, reaching high accuracy on DDxBench, a challenging open-ended differential diagnosis benchmark, while also capable of generating visually grounded, humanly-interpretable summary reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Driven Medical Document Analysis: Enhancing Trustworthy Pathology and Differential Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19702v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential clinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical tasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition among overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical expertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy concerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs services in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a trustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using low-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks. Our approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential diagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and variable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The developed web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured medical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By incorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures transparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence. Extensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility in clinical settings. This work addresses the urgent need for reliable, explainable, and privacy-preserving artificial intelligence solutions, representing a significant advancement in intelligent medical document analysis for real-world healthcare applications.

In digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images, such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over 20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for digital pathology images.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

To capture morphological changes that occur across scales during disease progression, our approach embeds tissue and corresponding nucleus images close to each other based on inclusion relationships. Using the Poincaré ball as the feature space enables effective encoding of this hierarchical structure.

Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color (decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cost-effective Instruction Learning for Pathology Vision and Language Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17734v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of vision-language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI-enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large-scale training data, financial, and computational resources. Here we propose a cost-effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT-4, we propose well-designed prompts on GPT-3.5 for building generation-based instructions, emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions, we construct a high-quality set of template-based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets, our findings reveal the strength of hybrid-form instructions in the visual question-answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost-effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open-ended and closed-ended questions, where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT-4. Through the instruction tuning, CLOVER exhibits robustness of few-shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost-effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathCoT: Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Zero-shot Pathology Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01029v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors, leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual understanding and reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patho-R1: A Multimodal Reinforcement Learning-Based Pathology Expert Reasoner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11404v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled broad progress in the general medical field. However, pathology still remains a more challenging subdomain, with current pathology specific VLMs exhibiting limitations in both diagnostic accuracy and reasoning plausibility. Such shortcomings are largely attributable to the nature of current pathology datasets, which are primarily composed of image description pairs that lack the depth and structured diagnostic paradigms employed by real world pathologists. In this study, we leverage pathology textbooks and real world pathology experts to construct high-quality, reasoning-oriented datasets. Building on this, we introduce Patho-R1, a multimodal RL-based pathology Reasoner, trained through a three-stage pipeline: (1) continued pretraining on 3.5 million image-text pairs for knowledge infusion; (2) supervised fine-tuning on 500k high-quality Chain-of-Thought samples for reasoning incentivizing; (3) reinforcement learning using Group Relative Policy Optimization and Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization strategies for multimodal reasoning quality refinement. To further assess the alignment quality of our dataset, we propose Patho-CLIP, trained on the same figure-caption corpus used for continued pretraining. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that both Patho-CLIP and Patho-R1 achieve robust performance across a wide range of pathology-related tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, Visual Question Answering, and Multiple Choice Question. Our project is available at the Patho-R1 repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-R1.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods apply computer vision models directly to medical tasks, neglecting the distinct characteristics of pathological images. This mismatch often leads to computational inefficiencies, particularly in edge-computing scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Network Similarity Directed Initialization (NSDI) strategy to improve the stability of neural architecture search (NAS). Furthermore, we introduce domain adaptation into one-shot NAS to better handle variations in staining and semantic scale across pathology datasets. Experiments on the BRACS dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, delivering both superior classification performance and clinically relevant feature localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[A robust and scalable framework for hallucination detection in virtual tissue staining and digital pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18458v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathological staining of human tissue is essential for disease diagnosis. Recent advances in virtual tissue staining technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) alleviate some of the costly and tedious steps involved in traditional histochemical staining processes, permitting multiplexed staining and tissue preservation. However, potential hallucinations and artifacts in these virtually stained tissue images pose concerns, especially for the clinical uses of these approaches. Quality assessment of histology images by experts can be subjective. Here, we present an autonomous quality and hallucination assessment method, AQuA, for virtual tissue staining and digital pathology. AQuA autonomously achieves 99.8% accuracy when detecting acceptable and unacceptable virtually stained tissue images without access to histochemically stained ground truth, and presents an agreement of 98.5% with the manual assessments made by board-certified pathologists, including identifying realistic-looking images that could mislead diagnosticians. We demonstrate the wide adaptability of AQuA across various virtually and histochemically stained human tissue images. This framework enhances the reliability of virtual tissue staining and provides autonomous quality assurance for image generation and transformation tasks in digital pathology and computational imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 Pa...</summary><p>45 Pages, 22 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just 1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for future research and application in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Automated Quality Assurance in Digital Pathology: Tile Classification Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10916v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology, where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis. Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation. We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues. From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together (chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.</p></details> |  |

Conventional histopathological diagnosis suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on over 353 million multi-scale images from 210,043 H&E-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, protein expression status prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation. We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.70% sensitivity across nine independent medical institutions. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Single GPU Task Adaptation of Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05184v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Computation- and Communication-efficient Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02628v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the impressive performance across a wide range of applications, current computational pathology models face significant diagnostic efficiency challenges due to their reliance on high-magnification whole-slide image analysis. This limitation severely compromises their clinical utility, especially in time-sensitive diagnostic scenarios and situations requiring efficient data transfer. To address these issues, we present a novel computation- and communication-efficient framework called Magnification-Aligned Global-Local Transformer (MAG-GLTrans). Our approach significantly reduces computational time, file transfer requirements, and storage overhead by enabling effective analysis using low-magnification inputs rather than high-magnification ones. The key innovation lies in our proposed magnification alignment (MAG) mechanism, which employs self-supervised learning to bridge the information gap between low and high magnification levels by effectively aligning their feature representations. Through extensive evaluation across various fundamental CPath tasks, MAG-GLTrans demonstrates state-of-the-art classification performance while achieving remarkable efficiency gains: up to 10.7 times reduction in computational time and over 20 times reduction in file transfer and storage requirements. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of our MAG framework through two significant extensions: (1) its applicability as a feature extractor to enhance the efficiency of any CPath architecture, and (2) its compatibility with existing foundation models and histopathology-specific encoders, enabling them to process low-magnification inputs with minimal information loss. These advancements position MAG-GLTrans as a particularly promising solution for time-sensitive applications, especially in the context of intraoperative frozen section diagnosis where both accuracy and efficiency are paramount.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Butterfly Effect in Pathology: Exploring Security in Pathology Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24141v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore, we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable deployment of pathology foundation models.

| **[IRS: Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22855v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning is rapidly emerging as a key focus in computer vision, aiming to develop AI systems capable of continuous improvement, thereby enhancing their value and practicality in diverse real-world applications. In healthcare, continual learning holds great promise for continuously acquired digital pathology data, which is collected in hospitals on a daily basis. However, panoramic segmentation on digital whole slide images (WSIs) presents significant challenges, as it is often infeasible to obtain comprehensive annotations for all potential objects, spanning from coarse structures (e.g., regions and unit objects) to fine structures (e.g., cells). This results in temporally and partially annotated data, posing a major challenge in developing a holistic segmentation framework. Moreover, an ideal segmentation model should incorporate new phenotypes, unseen diseases, and diverse populations, making this task even more complex. In this paper, we introduce a novel and unified Incremental Relationship-guided Segmentation (IRS) learning scheme to address temporally acquired, partially annotated data while maintaining out-of-distribution (OOD) continual learning capacity in digital pathology. The key innovation of IRS lies in its ability to realize a new spatial-temporal OOD continual learning paradigm by mathematically modeling anatomical relationships between existing and newly introduced classes through a simple incremental universal proposition matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that the IRS method effectively handles the multi-scale nature of pathological segmentation, enabling precise kidney segmentation across various structures (regions, units, and cells) as well as OOD disease lesions at multiple magnifications. This capability significantly enhances domain generalization, making IRS a robust approach for real-world digital pathology applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose PathFL, a novel multi-alignment Federated Learning framework for pathology image segmentation that addresses these challenges through three-level alignment strategies of image, feature, and model aggregation. Firstly, at the image level, a collaborative style enhancement module aligns and diversifies local data by facilitating style information exchange across clients. Secondly, at the feature level, an adaptive feature alignment module ensures implicit alignment in the representation space by infusing local features with global insights, promoting consistency across heterogeneous client features learning. Finally, at the model aggregation level, a stratified similarity aggregation strategy hierarchically aligns and aggregates models on the server, using layer-specific similarity to account for client discrepancies and enhance global generalization. Comprehensive evaluations on four sets of heterogeneous pathology image datasets, encompassing cross-source, cross-modality, cross-organ, and cross-scanner variations, validate the effectiveness of our PathFL in achieving better performance and robustness against data heterogeneity.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures; Accepted by MedIA</p></details> |

While these models show remarkable potential across cancer diagnostics and prognostics, their clinical translation faces critical challenges including variability in optimal model across cancer types, potential data leakage in evaluation, and lack of standardized benchmarks. Without rigorous, unbiased evaluation, even the most advanced PFMs risk remaining confined to research settings, delaying their life-saving applications. Existing benchmarking efforts remain limited by narrow cancer-type focus, potential pretraining data overlaps, or incomplete task coverage. We present PathBench, the first comprehensive benchmark addressing these gaps through: multi-center in-hourse datasets spanning common cancers with rigorous leakage prevention, evaluation across the full clinical spectrum from diagnosis to prognosis, and an automated leaderboard system for continuous model assessment. Our framework incorporates large-scale data, enabling objective comparison of PFMs while reflecting real-world clinical complexity. All evaluation data comes from private medical providers, with strict exclusion of any pretraining usage to avoid data leakage risks. We have collected 15,888 WSIs from 8,549 patients across 10 hospitals, encompassing over 64 diagnosis and prognosis tasks. Currently, our evaluation of 19 PFMs shows that Virchow2 and H-Optimus-1 are the most effective models overall. This work provides researchers with a robust platform for model development and offers clinicians actionable insights into PFM performance across diverse clinical scenarios, ultimately accelerating the translation of these transformative technologies into routine pathology practice.</p></details> | 35 pages, 9 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose PathoSCOPE, a few-shot unsupervised pathology detection framework that requires only a small set of non-pathological samples (minimum 2 shots), significantly improving data efficiency. We introduce Global-Local Contrastive Loss (GLCL), comprised of a Local Contrastive Loss to reduce the variability of non-pathological embeddings and a Global Contrastive Loss to enhance the discrimination of pathological regions. We also propose a Pathology-informed Embedding Generation (PiEG) module that synthesizes pathological embeddings guided by the global loss, better exploiting the limited non-pathological samples. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 and ChestXray8 datasets, PathoSCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods while maintaining computational efficiency (2.48 GFLOPs, 166 FPS).</p></details> |  |
| **[Artificial intelligence in digital pathology: a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07999v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring diagnostic performance of AI models before clinical use is key to the safe and successful adoption of these technologies. Studies reporting AI applied to digital pathology images for diagnostic purposes have rapidly increased in number in recent years. The aim of this work is to provide an overview of the diagnostic accuracy of AI in digital pathology images from all areas of pathology. This systematic review and meta-analysis included diagnostic accuracy studies using any type of artificial intelligence applied to whole slide images (WSIs) in any disease type. The reference standard was diagnosis through histopathological assessment and / or immunohistochemistry. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL in June 2022. We identified 2976 studies, of which 100 were included in the review and 48 in the full meta-analysis. Risk of bias and concerns of applicability were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data extraction was conducted by two investigators and meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random effects model. 100 studies were identified for inclusion, equating to over 152,000 whole slide images (WSIs) and representing many disease types. Of these, 48 studies were included in the meta-analysis. These studies reported a mean sensitivity of 96.3% (CI 94.1-97.7) and mean specificity of 93.3% (CI 90.5-95.4) for AI. There was substantial heterogeneity in study design and all 100 studies identified for inclusion had at least one area at high or unclear risk of bias. This review provides a broad overview of AI performance across applications in whole slide imaging. However, there is huge variability in study design and available performance data, with details around the conduct of the study and make up of the datasets frequently missing. Overall, AI offers good accuracy when applied to WSIs but requires more rigorous evaluation of its performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables + Supplementary materials Preprint is pre-peer review version.

| **[Discovering Pathology Rationale and Token Allocation for Efficient Multimodal Pathology Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15687v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal pathological image understanding has garnered widespread interest due to its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and enable personalized treatment through integrated visual and textual data. However, existing methods exhibit limited reasoning capabilities, which hamper their ability to handle complex diagnostic scenarios. Additionally, the enormous size of pathological images leads to severe computational burdens, further restricting their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel bilateral reinforcement learning framework comprising two synergistic branches. One reinforcement branch enhances the reasoning capability by enabling the model to learn task-specific decision processes, i.e., pathology rationales, directly from labels without explicit reasoning supervision. While the other branch dynamically allocates a tailored number of tokens to different images based on both their visual content and task context, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. We apply our method to various pathological tasks such as visual question answering, cancer subtyping, and lesion detection. Extensive experiments show an average +41.7 absolute performance improvement with 70.3% lower inference costs over the base models, achieving both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04045v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12711v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segmentation of temporomandibular joint structures on mri images using neural networks for diagnosis of pathologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12963v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article explores the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis of pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), in particular, for the segmentation of the articular disc on MRI images. The relevance of the work is due to the high prevalence of TMJ pathologies, as well as the need to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis in medical institutions. During the study, the existing solutions (Diagnocat, MandSeg) were analyzed, which, as a result, are not suitable for studying the articular disc due to the orientation towards bone structures. To solve the problem, an original dataset was collected from 94 images with the classes "temporomandibular joint" and "jaw". To increase the amount of data, augmentation methods were used. After that, the models of U-Net, YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n and Roboflow neural networks were trained and compared. The evaluation was carried out according to the Dice Score, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Mean Average Precision metrics. The results confirm the potential of using the Roboflow model for segmentation of the temporomandibular joint. In the future, it is planned to develop an algorithm for measuring the distance between the jaws and determining the position of the articular disc, which will improve the diagnosis of TMJ pathologies.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[HISTAI: An Open-Source, Large-Scale Whole Slide Image Dataset for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12120v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Digital Pathology (DP), particularly through artificial intelligence and Foundation Models, have underscored the importance of large-scale, diverse, and richly annotated datasets. Despite their critical role, publicly available Whole Slide Image (WSI) datasets often lack sufficient scale, tissue diversity, and comprehensive clinical metadata, limiting the robustness and generalizability of AI models. In response, we introduce the HISTAI dataset, a large, multimodal, open-access WSI collection comprising over 60,000 slides from various tissue types. Each case in the HISTAI dataset is accompanied by extensive clinical metadata, including diagnosis, demographic information, detailed pathological annotations, and standardized diagnostic coding. The dataset aims to fill gaps identified in existing resources, promoting innovation, reproducibility, and the development of clinically relevant computational pathology solutions.

| **[Efficient and Comprehensive Feature Extraction in Large Vision-Language Model for Pathology Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09521v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological diagnosis is vital for determining disease characteristics, guiding treatment, and assessing prognosis, relying heavily on detailed, multi-scale analysis of high-resolution whole slide images (WSI). However, existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) are limited by input resolution constraints, hindering their efficiency and accuracy in pathology image analysis. To overcome these issues, we propose two innovative strategies: the mixed task-guided feature enhancement, which directs feature extraction toward lesion-related details across scales, and the prompt-guided detail feature completion, which integrates coarse- and fine-grained features from WSI based on specific prompts without compromising inference speed. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 490K samples from diverse pathology tasks, we trained the pathology-specialized LVLM, OmniPath. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this model significantly outperforms existing methods in diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing an interactive, clinically aligned approach for auxiliary diagnosis in a wide range of pathology applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimMIL: A Universal Weakly Supervised Pre-Training Framework for Multi-Instance Learning in Whole Slide Pathology Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06710v1)** | 2025-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Various multi-instance learning (MIL) based approaches have been developed and successfully applied to whole-slide pathological images (WSI). Existing MIL methods emphasize the importance of feature aggregators, but largely neglect the instance-level representation learning. They assume that the availability of a pre-trained feature extractor can be directly utilized or fine-tuned, which is not always the case. This paper proposes to pre-train feature extractor for MIL via a weakly-supervised scheme, i.e., propagating the weak bag-level labels to the corresponding instances for supervised learning. To learn effective features for MIL, we further delve into several key components, including strong data augmentation, a non-linear prediction head and the robust loss function. We conduct experiments on common large-scale WSI datasets and find it achieves better performance than other pre-training schemes (e.g., ImageNet pre-training and self-supervised learning) in different downstream tasks. We further show the compatibility and scalability of the proposed scheme by deploying it in fine-tuning the pathological-specific models and pre-training on merged multiple datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on the representation learning for MIL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13754v3)** | 2025-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/CMSwinKAN.</p></details> | 10pages, 8 figures |
| **[Beyond the Monitor: Mixed Reality Visualization and AI for Enhanced Digital Pathology Workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02780v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists rely on gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) to diagnose diseases like cancer, yet current digital pathology tools hinder diagnosis. The immense scale of WSIs, often exceeding 100,000 X 100,000 pixels, clashes with the limited views traditional monitors offer. This mismatch forces constant panning and zooming, increasing pathologist cognitive load, causing diagnostic fatigue, and slowing pathologists' adoption of digital methods. PathVis, our mixed-reality visualization platform for Apple Vision Pro, addresses these challenges. It transforms the pathologist's interaction with data, replacing cumbersome mouse-and-monitor navigation with intuitive exploration using natural hand gestures, eye gaze, and voice commands in an immersive workspace. PathVis integrates AI to enhance diagnosis. An AI-driven search function instantly retrieves and displays the top five similar patient cases side-by-side, improving diagnostic precision and efficiency through rapid comparison. Additionally, a multimodal conversational AI assistant offers real-time image interpretation support and aids collaboration among pathologists across multiple Apple devices. By merging the directness of traditional pathology with advanced mixed-reality visualization and AI, PathVis improves diagnostic workflows, reduces cognitive strain, and makes pathology practice more effective and engaging. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis</p></details> |  |

The proposed Multimodal Doctor-in-the-Loop method further enhances clinical relevance by embedding clinicians' domain knowledge directly into the training process, guiding the model's focus gradually from broader lung regions to specific lesions.

| **[Self-Supervision Enhances Instance-based Multiple Instance Learning Methods in Digital Pathology: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01109v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as the best solution for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging (SPIE)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Zero-Shot Diagnostic Pathology in Vision-Language Models with Efficient Prompt Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00134v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have gained significant attention in computational pathology due to their multimodal learning capabilities that enhance big-data analytics of giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI). However, their sensitivity to large-scale clinical data, task formulations, and prompt design remains an open question, particularly in terms of diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation and analysis of three state of the art VLMs for histopathology, namely Quilt-Net, Quilt-LLAVA, and CONCH, on an in-house digestive pathology dataset comprising 3,507 WSIs, each in giga-pixel form, across distinct tissue types. Through a structured ablative study on cancer invasiveness and dysplasia status, we develop a comprehensive prompt engineering framework that systematically varies domain specificity, anatomical precision, instructional framing, and output constraints. Our findings demonstrate that prompt engineering significantly impacts model performance, with the CONCH model achieving the highest accuracy when provided with precise anatomical references. Additionally, we identify the critical importance of anatomical context in histopathological image analysis, as performance consistently degraded when reducing anatomical precision. We also show that model complexity alone does not guarantee superior performance, as effective domain alignment and domain-specific training are critical. These results establish foundational guidelines for prompt engineering in computational pathology and highlight the potential of VLMs to enhance diagnostic accuracy when properly instructed with domain-appropriate prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeDSLIP: Medical Dual-Stream Language-Image Pre-training with Pathology-Anatomy Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10635v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology and anatomy are two essential groups of semantics in medical data. Pathology describes what the diseases are, while anatomy explains where the diseases occur. They describe diseases from different perspectives, providing complementary insights into diseases. Thus, properly understanding these semantics and their relationships can enhance medical vision-language models (VLMs). However, pathology and anatomy semantics are usually entangled in medical data, hindering VLMs from explicitly modeling these semantics and their relationships. To address this challenge, we propose MeDSLIP, a novel Medical Dual-Stream Language-Image Pre-training pipeline, to disentangle pathology and anatomy semantics and model the relationships between them. We introduce a dual-stream mechanism in MeDSLIP to explicitly disentangle medical semantics into pathology-relevant and anatomy-relevant streams and align visual and textual information within each stream. Furthermore, we propose an interaction modeling module with prototypical contrastive learning loss and intra-image contrastive learning loss to regularize the relationships between pathology and anatomy semantics. We apply MeDSLIP to chest X-ray analysis and conduct comprehensive evaluations with four benchmark datasets: NIH CXR14, RSNA Pneumonia, SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax, and COVIDx CXR-4. The results demonstrate MeDSLIP's superior generalizability and transferability across different scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Shef-AIRE/MeDSLIP, and the pre-trained model is released at https://huggingface.co/pykale/MeDSLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Resolution Pathology-Language Pre-training Model with Text-Guided Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18856v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Computational Pathology (CPath), the introduction of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has opened new avenues for research, focusing primarily on aligning image-text pairs at a single magnification level. However, this approach might not be sufficient for tasks like cancer subtype classification, tissue phenotyping, and survival analysis due to the limited level of detail that a single-resolution image can provide. Addressing this, we propose a novel multi-resolution paradigm leveraging Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to extract histology patches at multiple resolutions and generate corresponding textual descriptions through advanced CPath VLM. We introduce visual-textual alignment at multiple resolutions as well as cross-resolution alignment to establish more effective text-guided visual representations. Cross-resolution alignment using a multimodal encoder enhances the model's ability to capture context from multiple resolutions in histology images. Our model aims to capture a broader range of information, supported by novel loss functions, enriches feature representation, improves discriminative ability, and enhances generalization across different resolutions. Pre-trained on a comprehensive TCGA dataset with 34 million image-language pairs at various resolutions, our fine-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts across multiple datasets and tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in CPath.

| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/tueimage/GABMIL}{\texttt{GABMIL}}.</p></details> |  |

Whole slide imaging promises numerous advantages; however, adoption is limited by challenges in ease of use and speed of high-quality image rendering relative to the simplicity and visual quality of glass slides. We introduce Iris, a new high-performance digital pathology rendering system. Specifically, we outline and detail the performance metrics of Iris Core, the core rendering engine technology. Iris Core comprises machine code modules written from the ground up in C++ and using Vulkan, a low-level and low-overhead cross-platform graphical processing unit application program interface, and our novel rapid tile buffering algorithms. We provide a detailed explanation of Iris Core's system architecture, including the stateless isolation of core processes, interprocess communication paradigms, and explicit synchronization paradigms that provide powerful control over the graphical processing unit. Iris Core achieves slide rendering at the sustained maximum frame rate on all tested platforms and buffers an entire new slide field of, view without overlapping pixels, in 10 ms with enhanced detail in 30 ms. It is able to buffer and compute high-fidelity reduction-enhancements for viewing low-power cytology with increased visual quality at a rate of 100-160 us per slide tile, and with a cumulative median buffering rate of 1.36 GB of decompressed image data per second. This buffering rate allows for an entirely new field of view to be fully buffered and rendered in less than a single monitor refresh on a standard display, and high detail features within 2-3 monitor refresh frames. These metrics far exceed previously published specifications, beyond an order of magnitude in some contexts. The system shows no slowing with high use loads, but rather increases performance due to cache mechanisms.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

This is a practical and applicable problem in clinics and hospitals, as WSIs are large, require storage, processing, and transfer time. Training new models whenever new tasks are defined is time-consuming. Recent work has applied regularization- and rehearsal-based methods to this setting. However, the rise of vision-language foundation models that align diagnostic text with pathology images raises the question: are these models alone sufficient for lifelong WSI learning using zero-shot classification, or is further investigation into continual learning strategies needed to improve performance? To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare conventional continual-learning approaches with vision-language zero-shot classification for WSIs.

Traditional multimodal models typically emphasize outcomes over the reasoning process, compromising the reliability of clinical decisions. To address the weak reasoning abilities and lack of supervised processes in pathological VLMs, we have innovatively proposed PathVLM-R1, a visual language model designed specifically for pathological images. We have based our model on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and enhanced its performance for pathological tasks through meticulously designed post-training strategies. Firstly, we conduct supervised fine-tuning guided by pathological data to imbue the model with foundational pathological knowledge, forming a new pathological base model. Subsequently, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and propose a dual reward-driven reinforcement learning optimization, ensuring strict constraint on logical supervision of the reasoning process and accuracy of results via cross-modal process reward and outcome accuracy reward. In the pathological image question-answering tasks, the testing results of PathVLM-R1 demonstrate a 14% improvement in accuracy compared to baseline methods, and it demonstrated superior performance compared to the Qwen2.5-VL-32B version despite having a significantly smaller parameter size. Furthermore, in out-domain data evaluation involving four medical imaging modalities: Computed Tomography (CT), dermoscopy, fundus photography, and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images: PathVLM-R1's transfer performance improved by an average of 17.3% compared to traditional SFT methods. These results clearly indicate that PathVLM-R1 not only enhances accuracy but also possesses broad applicability and expansion potential.</p></details> |  |

| **[Diagnose Like A REAL Pathologist: An Uncertainty-Focused Approach for Trustworthy Multi-Resolution Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06433v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing demand for histopathological specimen examination and diagnostic reporting, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has received heightened research focus as a viable solution for AI-centric diagnostic aid. Recently, to improve its performance and make it work more like a pathologist, several MIL approaches based on the use of multiple-resolution images have been proposed, delivering often higher performance than those that use single-resolution images. Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> |
| **[WSD-MIL: Window Scale Decay Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19982v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeltaMIL: Gated Memory Integration for Efficient and Discriminative Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19331v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are typically analyzed using multiple instance learning (MIL) methods. However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\% with UNI features. These results demonstrate the strong and consistent performance of DeltaMIL across diverse WSI tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages,7 figures,8 tables</p></details> |

This study investigates the potential of computational pathology to stratify patients using deep learning on routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). We developed and compared three Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks -- CLAM-SB, ABMIL, and ConvNeXt-MIL-XGBoost -- on an in-house dataset of 210 patient cases. The models were trained to predict 5-year recurrence risk, categorized into three tiers (low, medium, high), with ground truth labels established by the 21-gene Recurrence Score. Features were extracted using the UNI and CONCH pre-trained models. In a 5-fold cross-validation, the modified CLAM-SB model demonstrated the strongest performance, achieving a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.836 and a classification accuracy of 76.2%. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning on standard histology slides for automated, genomics-correlated risk stratification, highlighting a promising pathway toward rapid and cost-effective clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[CAPRMIL: Context-Aware Patch Representations for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14540v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

However, PFMs exhibit limitations on certain cancer or specimen types due to domain shifts - these cancer types were rarely used for pretraining or specimens contain tissue-based artifacts rarely seen within the pretraining population. Such is the case for transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which are essential for diagnosing muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), but contain fragmented tissue chips and electrocautery artifacts and were not widely used in publicly available PFMs. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective domain-adaptive self-supervised adaptor (DA-SSL) that realigns pretrained PFM features to the TURBT domain without fine-tuning the foundational model itself. We pilot this framework for predicting treatment response in TURBT, where histomorphological features are currently underutilized and identifying patients who will benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is challenging. In our multi-center study, DA-SSL achieved an AUC of 0.77+/-0.04 in five-fold cross-validation and an external test accuracy of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.91 using majority voting. Our results demonstrate that lightweight domain adaptation with self-supervision can effectively enhance PFM-based MIL pipelines for clinically challenging histopathology tasks.

| **[IMILIA: interpretable multiple instance learning for inflammation prediction in IBD from H&E whole slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13440v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the therapeutic target for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) shifts toward histologic remission, the accurate assessment of microscopic inflammation has become increasingly central for evaluating disease activity and response to treatment. In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-Shot Learning from Gigapixel Images via Hierarchical Vision-Language Alignment and Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17982v5)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1) insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales (e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x) visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2) heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast, lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data.

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths.

Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models designed for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification in computational pathology are rarely evaluated in terms of reliability, leaving a key gap in understanding their suitability for high-stakes applications like clinical decision-making. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing three quantitative metrics for reliability assessment and applying them to several widely used MIL architectures across three region-wise annotated pathology datasets. Our findings indicate that the mean pooling instance (MEAN-POOL-INS)model demonstrates superior reliability compared to other networks, despite its simple architectural design and computational efficiency. These findings underscore the need of reliability evaluation alongside predictive performance in MIL models and establish MEAN-POOL-INS as a strong, trustworthy baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |

Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths (up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential in the era of foundation models.

Prior work [Nachman and Thaler, 2021] argued that single-instance methods are often sufficient, but this conclusion presumes enough single-instance signal to train near-optimal classifiers. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art single-instance models can fail to reach optimal classifier performance in challenging low-signal regimes, whereas MIL can mitigate this sub-optimality. As a concrete application, we constrain Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) using kinematic information from subatomic particle collision events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In experiments, we observe that under specific modeling and weak signal conditions, pooling instances can increase the effective Fisher information compared to single-instance approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Refer...</summary><p>Referenced prior work to better frame the contribution</p></details> |

However, existing correlation methods suffer from two major limitations: limited robustness to noise and partial observations, and poor scalability due to computationally expensive pairwise matching. To address these challenges, we propose RECTor, a machine learning-based framework for traffic correlation under realistic conditions. RECTor employs attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and GRU-based temporal encoding to extract robust flow representations, even when traffic data is incomplete or obfuscated. These embeddings are mapped into a shared space via a Siamese network and efficiently matched using approximate nearest neighbor (aNN) search. Empirical evaluations show that RECTor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as DeepCorr, DeepCOFFEA, and FlowTracker, achieving up to 60% higher true positive rates under high-noise conditions and reducing training and inference time by over 50%. Moreover, RECTor demonstrates strong scalability: inference cost grows near-linearly as the number of flows increases.

Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

However, existing models evaluate the quality of retrieval based on proximity, which cannot guarantee that the retrieved pattern has the strongest association with the query, failing correctness. We reframe this problem by proposing that a query is a generative variant of a stored memory pattern, and define a variant distribution to model this subtle context-dependent generative process. Consequently, correct retrieval should return the memory pattern with the maximum a posteriori probability of being the query's origin. This perspective reveals that an ideal similarity measure should approximate the likelihood of each stored pattern generating the query in accordance with variant distribution, which is impossible for fixed and pre-defined similarities used by existing associative memories. To this end, we develop adaptive similarity, a novel mechanism that learns to approximate this insightful but unknown likelihood from samples drawn from context, aiming for correct retrieval. We theoretically prove that our proposed adaptive similarity achieves optimal correct retrieval under three canonical and widely applicable types of variants: noisy, masked, and biased. We integrate this mechanism into a novel adaptive Hopfield network (A-Hop), and empirical results show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, including memory retrieval, tabular classification, image classification, and multiple instance learning.</p></details> |  |

WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2026</p></details> |
| **[A Vector Symbolic Approach to Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16795v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.</p></details> |  |

We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction. It further demonstrated strong cross-model generalization, reliable uncertainty quantification, and robust survival stratification in multiple external cohorts. In conclusion, nnMIL offers a practical and generalizable solution for translating pathology foundation models into clinically meaningful predictions, advancing the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>A con...</summary><p>A conceptual evaluation work; more studies are in progress; examples are here (https://github.com/Luoxd1996/nnMIL)</p></details> |

Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted in MICCAI Workshop 2025</p></details> |

We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks. To facilitate reproducibility, we share our complete implementation and evaluation framework as open source: https://github.com/Ace95/SLAM-AGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Submitted to ISBI2026</p></details> |

Yet, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often acquired at gigapixel sizes, rendering them computationally infeasible to analyze entirely at high resolution. Diagnostic labels are largely available only at the slide-level, because expert annotation of images at a finer (patch) level is both laborious and expensive. Moreover, regions with diagnostic information typically occupy only a small fraction of the WSI, making it inefficient to examine the entire slide at full resolution. Here, we propose SASHA -- Sequential Attention-based Sampling for Histopathological Analysis -- a deep reinforcement learning approach for efficient analysis of histopathological images. First, SASHA learns informative features with a lightweight hierarchical, attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) model. Second, SASHA samples intelligently and zooms selectively into a small fraction (10-20\%) of high-resolution patches to achieve reliable diagnoses. We show that SASHA matches state-of-the-art methods that analyze the WSI fully at high resolution, albeit at a fraction of their computational and memory costs. In addition, it significantly outperforms competing, sparse sampling methods. We propose SASHA as an intelligent sampling model for medical imaging challenges that involve automated diagnosis with exceptionally large images containing sparsely informative features. Model implementation is available at: https://github.com/coglabiisc/SASHA.</p></details> |  |

However, manual examination of cytology whole slide images (WSIs) is slow, subjective, and depends heavily on expert pathologists. To address this, we introduce the first weakly supervised deep learning framework for patient-level diagnosis of oral cytology whole slide images, leveraging the newly released Oral Cytology Dataset [1], which provides annotated cytology WSIs from ten medical centres across India. Each patient case is represented as a bag of cytology patches and assigned a diagnosis label (Healthy, Benign, Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMD), OSCC) by an in-house expert pathologist. These patient-level weak labels form a new extension to the dataset. We evaluate a baseline multiple-instance learning (MIL) model and a proposed Region-Affinity Attention MIL (RAA-MIL) that models spatial relationships between regions within each slide. The RAA-MIL achieves an average accuracy of 72.7%, weighted F1-score of 0.69 on an unseen test set, outperforming the baseline. This study establishes the first patient-level weakly supervised benchmark for oral cytology and moves toward reliable AI-assisted digital pathology.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at IEEE ISBI 2026</p></details> |

Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective, motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50 features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE = 10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

In reality, LLMs encode information retained during training as internal probabilistic knowledge. This study examines existing methods for probing the veracity of that knowledge and identifies several flawed underlying assumptions. To address these flaws, we introduce sAwMIL (Sparse-Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a multiclass probing framework that combines multiple-instance learning with conformal prediction. sAwMIL leverages internal activations of LLMs to classify statements as true, false, or neither. We evaluate sAwMIL across 16 open-source LLMs, including default and chat-based variants, on three new curated datasets. Our results show that (1) common probing methods fail to provide a reliable and transferable veracity direction and, in some settings, perform worse than zero-shot prompting; (2) truth and falsehood are not encoded symmetrically; and (3) LLMs encode a third type of signal that is distinct from both true and false.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready (non-archival) version accepted at the Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop at NeurIPS 2025.

In many real-world settings, online interactions can be risky, and accurately specifying the reward and the safety cost information at each timestep can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories reflecting undesirable or risky behavior, implicitly conveying the behavior the agent should avoid. We refer to these trajectories as non-preferred trajectories. Unlike standard IL, which aims to mimic demonstrations, our agent must also learn to avoid risky behavior using non-preferred trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, SafeMIL, to learn a parameterized cost that predicts if the state-action pair is risky via Multiple Instance Learning. The learned cost is then used to avoid non-preferred behaviors, resulting in a policy that prioritizes safety. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn a safer policy that satisfies cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thereby outperforming several baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[MeCaMIL: Causality-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Fair and Interpretable Whole Slide Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11004v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>15pag...</summary><p>15page,5 figures,8 tables</p></details> |

A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.</p></details> |  |

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still do not achieve the best possible performance when trained with ten thousand training samples, each containing many instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[LBMamba: Locally Bi-directional Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15976v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM) that accelerates training by recasting recurrence as a parallel scan, has recently emerged as a linearly-scaling alternative to self-attention. Because of its unidirectional nature, each state in Mamba only has information of its previous states and is blind to states after. Current Mamba-based computer-vision methods typically overcome this by augmenting Mamba's global forward scan with a global backward scan, forming a bi-directional scan to restore a full receptive field. However, this operation doubles the computational load, eroding much of the efficiency advantage that originally Mamba have. To eliminate this extra scans, we introduce LBMamba, a locally bi-directional SSM block that embeds a lightweight locally backward scan inside the forward scan and executes it in per-thread registers. Building on LBMamba, we present LBVim, a backbone that alternates scan directions every two layers to recover a global receptive field without extra backward sweeps. We validate our approach on both natural images and whole slide images (WSIs) and show that it constantly offers a superior performance-throughput trade-off. Under the same throughput, LBVim achieves 0.8% to 1.6% higher top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K classification dataset, 0.6% to 2.7% higher mIoU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation dataset, 0.9% higher APb and 1.1% higher APm on the COCO detection dataset. Our method also boosts the accuracy of four SOTA Mamba models, namely VMamba, LocalVim, PlainMamba and Adventurer, by 0.5% to 3.4%. We integrate LBMamba into the SOTA pathology multiple instance learning (MIL) model, MambaMIL, which is unidirectional. Experiments on 3 public WSI classification datasets show that our method achieves a relative improvement of up to 3.06% better AUC, 3.39% better F1, 1.67% better accuracy.

To address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling. Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all state-of-the-art models.

In this work, we introduce a unified framework-Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks-which generalizes these models to a broader family of energy functions. Our energies are formulated as the difference between two Fenchel-Young losses: one, parameterized by a generalized entropy, defines the Hopfield scoring mechanism, while the other applies a post-transformation to the Hopfield output. By utilizing Tsallis and norm entropies, we derive end-to-end differentiable update rules that enable sparse transformations, uncovering new connections between loss margins, sparsity, and exact retrieval of single memory patterns. We further extend this framework to structured Hopfield networks using the SparseMAP transformation, allowing the retrieval of pattern associations rather than a single pattern. Our framework unifies and extends traditional and modern Hopfield networks and provides an energy minimization perspective for widely used post-transformations like $\ell_2$-normalization and layer normalization-all through suitable choices of Fenchel-Young losses and by using convex analysis as a building block. Finally, we validate our Hopfield-Fenchel-Young networks on diverse memory recall tasks, including free and sequential recall. Experiments on simulated data, image retrieval, multiple instance learning, and text rationalization demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.13725</p></details> |

However, performance limitations arise from the absence of encoder fine-tuning for downstream tasks and disjoint optimization with MIL. While slide-level supervised end-to-end (E2E) learning is an intuitive solution to this issue, it faces challenges such as high computational demands and suboptimal results. These limitations motivate us to revisit E2E learning. We argue that prior work neglects inherent E2E optimization challenges, leading to performance disparities compared to traditional two-stage methods. In this paper, we pioneer the elucidation of optimization challenge caused by sparse-attention MIL and propose a novel MIL called ABMILX. It mitigates this problem through global correlation-based attention refinement and multi-head mechanisms. With the efficient multi-scale random patch sampling strategy, an E2E trained ResNet with ABMILX surpasses SOTA foundation models under the two-stage paradigm across multiple challenging benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient (<10 RTX3090 hours). We show the potential of E2E learning in CPath and calls for greater research focus in this area.

This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction. We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures. FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.</p></details> |  |

Our approach harnesses the capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded, using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 (Highlights)</p></details> |

However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based system to improve cribriform pattern detection. Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430 patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261 slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort. Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.

| **[PRVR: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12510v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI.

| **[A deep multiple instance learning approach based on coarse labels for high-resolution land-cover mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06769v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning (DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, accepted conference paper at SPIE REMOTE SENSING, 3-7 September 2023, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p></details> |
| **[From Segments to Concepts: Interpretable Image Classification via Concept-Guided Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04180v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision; however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent, concept-level explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EfficientMIL: Efficient Linear-Complexity MIL Method for WSI Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23640v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.</p></details> | Submitted to Array |

Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[LadderMIL: Multiple Instance Learning with Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02707v4)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology often neglects instance-level learning as supervision is typically provided only at the bag level, hindering the integrated consideration of instance and bag-level information during the analysis. In this work, we present LadderMIL, a framework designed to improve MIL through two perspectives: (1) employing instance-level supervision and (2) learning inter-instance contextual information at bag level. Firstly, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Self-Distillation (CFSD) paradigm that probes and distils a network trained with bag-level information to adaptively obtain instance-level labels which could effectively provide the instance-level supervision for the same network in a self-improving way. Secondly, to capture inter-instance contextual information in WSI, we propose a Contextual Encoding Generator (CEG), which encodes the contextual appearance of instances within a bag. We also theoretically and empirically prove the instance-level learnability of CFSD. Our LadderMIL is evaluated on multiple clinically relevant benchmarking tasks including breast cancer receptor status classification, multi-class subtype classification, tumour classification, and prognosis prediction. Average improvements of 8.1%, 11% and 2.4% in AUC, F1-score, and C-index, respectively, are demonstrated across the five benchmarks, compared to the best baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[C$^2$MIL: Synchronizing Semantic and Topological Causalities in Multiple Instance Learning for Robust and Interpretable Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20152v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL. C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities. Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement for diverse MIL baselines.

Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

| **[Multi-View Attention Multiple-Instance Learning Enhanced by LLM Reasoning for Cognitive Distortion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17292v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive distortions have been closely linked to mental health disorders, yet their automatic detection remained challenging due to contextual ambiguity, co-occurrence, and semantic overlap. We proposed a novel framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) architecture to enhance interpretability and expression-level reasoning. Each utterance was decomposed into Emotion, Logic, and Behavior (ELB) components, which were processed by LLMs to infer multiple distortion instances, each with a predicted type, expression, and model-assigned salience score. These instances were integrated via a Multi-View Gated Attention mechanism for final classification. Experiments on Korean (KoACD) and English (Therapist QA) datasets demonstrate that incorporating ELB and LLM-inferred salience scores improves classification performance, especially for distortions with high interpretive ambiguity. Our results suggested a psychologically grounded and generalizable approach for fine-grained reasoning in mental health NLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Instance Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06544v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore multiple instance verification, a problem setting in which a query instance is verified against a bag of target instances with heterogeneous, unknown relevancy. We show that naive adaptations of attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods and standard verification methods like Siamese neural networks are unsuitable for this setting: directly combining state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods and Siamese networks is shown to be no better, and sometimes significantly worse, than a simple baseline model. Postulating that this may be caused by the failure of the representation of the target bag to incorporate the query instance, we introduce a new pooling approach named "cross-attention pooling" (CAP). Under the CAP framework, we propose two novel attention functions to address the challenge of distinguishing between highly similar instances in a target bag. Through empirical studies on three different verification tasks, we demonstrate that CAP outperforms adaptations of SOTA MIL methods and the baseline by substantial margins, in terms of both classification accuracy and the ability to detect key instances. The superior ability to identify key instances is attributed to the new attention functions by ablation studies. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV.</p></details> | JMLR 2025 |
| **[Multiple Instance Learning Framework with Masked Hard Instance Mining for Gigapixel Histopathology Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11526v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digitizing pathological images into gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) has opened new avenues for Computational Pathology (CPath). As positive tissue comprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that hard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries. Applying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a class-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask salient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student model. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale random masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of losing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes optimization. Experimental results on cancer diagnosis, subtyping, survival analysis tasks, and 12 benchmarks demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms the latest methods in both performance and efficiency.

| **[Weakly Supervised Vulnerability Localization via Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11312v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerability detection has emerged as a significant concern in the field of software security recently, capturing the attention of numerous researchers and developers. Most previous approaches focus on coarse-grained vulnerability detection, such as at the function or file level. However, the developers would still encounter the challenge of manually inspecting a large volume of code inside the vulnerable function to identify the specific vulnerable statements for modification, indicating the importance of vulnerability localization. Training the model for vulnerability localization usually requires ground-truth labels at the statement-level, and labeling vulnerable statements demands expert knowledge, which incurs high costs. Hence, the demand for an approach that eliminates the need for additional labeling at the statement-level is on the rise. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called WAVES for WeAkly supervised Vulnerability Localization via multiplE inStance learning, which does not need the additional statement-level labels during the training. WAVES has the capability to determine whether a function is vulnerable (i.e., vulnerability detection) and pinpoint the vulnerable statements (i.e., vulnerability localization). Specifically, inspired by the concept of multiple instance learning, WAVES converts the ground-truth label at the function-level into pseudo labels for individual statements, eliminating the need for additional statement-level labeling. These pseudo labels are utilized to train the classifiers for the function-level representation vectors. Extensive experimentation on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrates that, in comparison to previous baselines, our approach achieves comparable performance in vulnerability detection and state-of-the-art performance in statement-level vulnerability localization.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm relies on using a large number of labeled WSIs for training. The lack of training data and the presence of rare diseases pose significant challenges for these methods. Prompt tuning combined with pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) is an effective solution to the Few-shot Weakly Supervised WSI Classification (FSWC) task. Nevertheless, applying prompt tuning methods designed for natural images to WSIs presents three significant challenges: 1) These methods fail to fully leverage the prior knowledge from the VLM's text modality; 2) They overlook the essential multi-scale and contextual information in WSIs, leading to suboptimal results; and 3) They lack exploration of instance aggregation methods. To address these problems, we propose a Multi-Scale and Context-focused Prompt Tuning (MSCPT) method for FSWC task. Specifically, MSCPT employs the frozen large language model to generate pathological visual language prior knowledge at multiple scales, guiding hierarchical prompt tuning. Additionally, we design a graph prompt tuning module to learn essential contextual information within WSI, and finally, a non-parametric cross-guided instance aggregation module has been introduced to derive the WSI-level features. Extensive experiments, visualizations, and interpretability analyses were conducted on five datasets and three downstream tasks using three VLMs, demonstrating the strong performance of our MSCPT.

Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025 Workshop COMPAYL</p></details> |

In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Multiple instance learning (MIL) remains an essential next step following foundation model, designing a framework to aggregate patch-level features into slide-level predictions. We present EAGLE-Net, a structure-preserving, attention-guided MIL architecture designed to augment prediction and interpretability. EAGLE-Net integrates multi-scale absolute spatial encoding to capture global tissue architecture, a top-K neighborhood-aware loss to focus attention on local microenvironments, and background suppression loss to minimize false positives. We benchmarked EAGLE-Net on large pan-cancer datasets, including three cancer types for classification (10,260 slides) and seven cancer types for survival prediction (4,172 slides), using three distinct histology foundation backbones (REMEDIES, Uni-V1, Uni2-h). Across tasks, EAGLE-Net achieved up to 3% higher classification accuracy and the top concordance indices in 6 of 7 cancer types, producing smooth, biologically coherent attention maps that aligned with expert annotations and highlighted invasive fronts, necrosis, and immune infiltration. These results position EAGLE-Net as a generalizable, interpretable framework that complements foundation models, enabling improved biomarker discovery, prognostic modeling, and clinical decision support</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 7 main Figures, 8 Extended Data Figures</p></details> |

Graph-based MIL (GNN-MIL) approaches have emerged as powerful solutions for capturing contextual information in WSIs, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy. However, WSIs require significant computational and infrastructural resources, limiting accessibility in resource-constrained settings. Conventional light microscopes offer a cost-effective alternative, but applying GNN-MIL to such data is challenging due to extensive redundant images and missing spatial coordinates, which hinder contextual learning. To address these issues, we introduce MicroMIL, the first weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically designed for images acquired from conventional light microscopes. MicroMIL leverages a representative image extractor (RIE) that employs deep cluster embedding (DCE) and hard Gumbel-Softmax to dynamically reduce redundancy and select representative images. These images serve as graph nodes, with edges computed via cosine similarity, eliminating the need for spatial coordinates while preserving contextual information. Extensive experiments on a real-world colon cancer dataset and the BreakHis dataset demonstrate that MicroMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both diagnostic accuracy and robustness to redundancy.

Most prior work employs satellite imagery for county-level corn yield prediction by spatially aggregating all pixels within a county into a single value, potentially overlooking the detailed information and valuable insights offered by more granular data. To this end, this research examines each county at the pixel level and applies multiple instance learning to leverage detailed information within a county. In addition, our method addresses the "mixed pixel" issue caused by the inconsistent resolution between feature datasets and crop mask, which may introduce noise into the model and therefore hinder accurate yield prediction. Specifically, the attention mechanism is employed to automatically assign weights to different pixels, which can mitigate the influence of mixed pixels. The experimental results show that the developed model outperforms four other machine learning models over the past five years in the U.S. corn belt and demonstrates its best performance in 2022, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.84 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.83. This paper demonstrates the advantages of our approach from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Furthermore, through an in-depth study of the relationship between mixed pixels and attention, it is verified that our approach can capture critical feature information while filtering out noise from mixed pixels.</p></details> | <details><summary>I am ...</summary><p>I am writing to request the resubmission of my paper submitted to arXiv</p></details> |

While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion), HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

Due to the lack of fine-grained behavior-level annotations, detecting specific behavior-level anomalies within user behavior sequences is challenging. Unsupervised methods face high false positive rates and miss rates due to the inherent ambiguity between normal and anomalous behaviors. In this work, we instead introduce weak labels of behavior sequences, which have lower annotation costs, i.e., the training labels (anomalous or normal) are at sequence-level instead of behavior-level, to enhance the detection capability for behavior-level anomalies by learning discriminative features. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called Robust Multi-sphere Learning (RMSL). RMSL uses multiple hyper-spheres to represent the normal patterns of behaviors. Initially, a one-class classifier is constructed as a good anomaly-supervision-free starting point. Building on this, using multiple instance learning and adaptive behavior-level self-training debiasing based on model prediction confidence, the framework further refines hyper-spheres and feature representations using weak sequence-level labels. This approach enhances the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMSL significantly improves the performance of behavior-level insider threat detection.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive endeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to its distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features. Consequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning models for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological images from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three senior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern attention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze and diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images. Specifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn STAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces. Transformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation modules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology, suppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global representations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents feature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrated that STAMP achieved competitive diagnostic results on STAS-SXY, STAS-TXY and STAS-TCGA, with AUCs of 0.8058, 0.8017, and 0.7928, respectively, surpassing the clinical level.</p></details> | Submit to AAAI2026 |

However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>EXAON...</summary><p>EXAONE Path 2.0 technical report</p></details> |

However, these methods remain outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC) comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions, offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic training data is severely limited.

| **[Pediatric brain tumor classification using digital histopathology and deep learning: evaluation of SOTA methods on a multi-center Swedish cohort](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01330v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and young adults, but the scarcity of large histopathology datasets has limited the application of computational pathology in this group. This study implements two weakly supervised multiple-instance learning (MIL) approaches on patch-features obtained from state-of-the-art histology-specific foundation models to classify pediatric brain tumors in hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images (WSIs) from a multi-center Swedish cohort. WSIs from 540 subjects (age 8.5$\pm$4.9 years) diagnosed with brain tumor were gathered from the six Swedish university hospitals. Instance (patch)-level features were obtained from WSIs using three pre-trained feature extractors: ResNet50, UNI, and CONCH. Instances were aggregated using attention-based MIL (ABMIL) or clustering-constrained attention MIL (CLAM) for patient-level classification. Models were evaluated on three classification tasks based on the hierarchical classification of pediatric brain tumors: tumor category, family, and type. Model generalization was assessed by training on data from two of the centers and testing on data from four other centers. Model interpretability was evaluated through attention mapping. The highest classification performance was achieved using UNI features and ABMIL aggregation, with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.76$\pm$0.04, 0.63$\pm$0.04, and 0.60$\pm$0.05 for tumor category, family, and type classification, respectively. When evaluating generalization, models utilizing UNI and CONCH features outperformed those using ResNet50. However, the drop in performance from the in-site to out-of-site testing was similar across feature extractors. These results show the potential of state-of-the-art computational pathology methods in diagnosing pediatric brain tumors at different hierarchical levels with fair generalizability on a multi-center national dataset.</p></details> |  |

This paper pioneers EEG-language models (ELMs) trained on clinical reports and 15000 EEGs. We propose to combine multimodal alignment in this novel domain with timeseries cropping and text segmentation, enabling an extension based on multiple instance learning to alleviate misalignment between irrelevant EEG or text segments. Our multimodal models significantly improve over EEG-only models across four clinical evaluations and for the first time enable zero-shot classification as well as retrieval of both neural signals and reports.

Recently, Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) has made significant progress, allowing for classification based on slide-level, rather than patch-level, annotations. However, existing MIL methods ignore that all patches from normal slides are normal. Using this free annotation, we introduce a semi-supervision signal to de-bias the inter-slide variability and to capture the common factors of variation within normal patches. Because our method is orthogonal to the MIL algorithm, we evaluate our method on top of the recently proposed MIL algorithms and also compare the performance with other semi-supervised approaches. We evaluate our method on two public WSI datasets including Camelyon-16 and TCGA lung cancer and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the predictive performance of existing MIL algorithms and outperforms other semi-supervised algorithms. We release our code at https://github.com/AITRICS/pathology_mil.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2024</p></details> |

Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MICCAI 2025 workshop on Efficient Medical AI</p></details> |

To address the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs. Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians consider relevant to RA progression.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI AMAI Workshop 2025</p></details> |
| **[Deformable Attention Graph Representation Learning for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05382v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) and Regions of Interest (ROIs) is a fundamental challenge in computational pathology. While mainstream approaches often adopt Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), they struggle to capture the spatial dependencies among tissue structures. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a solution to model inter-instance relationships, yet most rely on static graph topologies and overlook the physical spatial positions of tissue patches. Moreover, conventional attention mechanisms lack specificity, limiting their ability to focus on structurally relevant regions. In this work, we propose a novel GNN framework with deformable attention for pathology image analysis. We construct a dynamic weighted directed graph based on patch features, where each node aggregates contextual information from its neighbors via attention-weighted edges. Specifically, we incorporate learnable spatial offsets informed by the real coordinates of each patch, enabling the model to adaptively attend to morphologically relevant regions across the slide. This design significantly enhances the contextual field while preserving spatial specificity. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets (TCGA-COAD, BRACS, gastric intestinal metaplasia grading, and intestinal ROI classification), demonstrating the power of deformable attention in capturing complex spatial structures in WSIs and ROIs.</p></details> |  |

However, the robustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences across data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical challenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological signals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning framework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2 architecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a real-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide images from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates slide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful representations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF image tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic profiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in attention-based multiple instance learning. While demonstrated on mIF data, AdvDINO is broadly applicable to other imaging domains -- including radiology, remote sensing, and autonomous driving -- where domain shift and limited annotated data hinder model generalization and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |

To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Priority-Aware Clinical Pathology Hierarchy Training for Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20469v2)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios. Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with multiple symptoms.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for oral presentation by The 2nd MICCAI Student Board (MSB) EMERGE Workshop</p></details> |

This topic has been extensively studied in histopathological image analysis, where labels are usually available only at the whole slide image (WSI) level, while each WSI could be divided into thousands of small image patches for training. The dominant MIL approaches focus on feature aggregation and take fixed patch features as inputs. However, weakly supervised feature representation learning in MIL settings is always neglected. Those features used to be generated by self-supervised learning methods that do not utilize weak labels, or by foundation encoders pre-trained on other large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised feature representation learning method called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning (WeakSupCon) that utilizes bag-level labels. In our method, we employ multi-task learning and define distinct contrastive losses for samples with different bag labels. Our experiments demonstrate that the features generated using WeakSupCon with limited computing resources significantly enhance MIL classification performance compared to self-supervised approaches across three datasets.

Deep Learning (DL) has been at the center of modern CPath, and while it delivers unprecedented performance, it is also known that DL may be affected by irrelevant details, such as those introduced during scanning by different commercially available scanners. This may lead to scanner bias, where the model outputs for the same tissue acquired by different scanners may vary. In turn, it hinders the trust of clinicians in CPath-based tools and their deployment in real-world clinical practices. Recent pathology Foundation Models (FMs) promise to provide better domain generalization capabilities. In this paper, we benchmark FMs using a multi-scanner dataset and show that FMs still suffer from scanner bias. Following this observation, we propose ScanGen, a contrastive loss function applied during task-specific fine-tuning that mitigates scanner bias, thereby enhancing the models' robustness to scanner variations. Our approach is applied to the Multiple Instance Learning task of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation prediction from H\&E-stained WSIs in lung cancer. We observe that ScanGen notably enhances the ability to generalize across scanners, while retaining or improving the performance of EGFR mutation prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted (Oral) in MedAGI 2025 International Workshop at MICCAI Conference</p></details> |

Accurate early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is essential for guiding personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we present an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework designed to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) directly from pre-treatment hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy slides. The model was trained on a retrospective in-house cohort of 174 TNBC patients and externally validated on an independent cohort (n = 30). It achieved a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 during five-fold cross-validation and 0.78 on external testing, demonstrating robust predictive performance and generalizability. To enhance model interpretability, attention maps were spatially co-registered with multiplex immuno-histochemistry (mIHC) data stained for PD-L1, CD8+ T cells, and CD163+ macrophages. The attention regions exhibited moderate spatial overlap with immune-enriched areas, with mean Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.47 for PD-L1, 0.45 for CD8+ T cells, and 0.46 for CD163+ macrophages. The presence of these biomarkers in high-attention regions supports their biological relevance to NACT response in TNBC. This not only improves model interpretability but may also inform future efforts to identify clinically actionable histological biomarkers directly from H&E-stained biopsy slides, further supporting the utility of this approach for accurate NACT response prediction and advancing precision oncology in TNBC.</p></details> |  |

Existing MIL methods face challenges in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks, using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, a critical limitation of current MIL methods lies in the underutilization of pre-training for the MIL aggregator. Most existing approaches initialize the aggregator randomly and train it from scratch, making performance highly sensitive to the quantity of labeled WSIs and ignoring the abundance of unlabeled WSIs commonly available in clinical settings. To address this, we propose PreMix, a novel framework that leverages a non-contrastive pre-training method, Barlow Twins, augmented with the Slide Mixing approach to generate additional positive pairs and enhance feature learning, particularly under limited labeled WSI conditions. Fine-tuning with Mixup and Manifold Mixup further enhances robustness by effectively handling the diverse sizes of gigapixel WSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating PreMix as a plug-in module into HIPT yields an average F1 improvement of 4.7% over the baseline HIPT across various WSI training sizes and datasets. These findings underscore its potential to advance WSI classification with limited labeled data and its applicability to real-world histopathology practices.

| **[Leveraging Spatial Context for Positive Pair Sampling in Histopathology Image Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05170v2)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has shown strong potential in cancer classification from whole-slide images (WSIs), but the need for extensive expert annotations often limits its success. Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance learning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising alternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL methods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to capture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we propose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances SSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches within WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint embedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We evaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and patch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\% to 10\% compared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the value of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational pathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining models in annotation-limited settings.

MIL methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training. Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven} state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are interpretable in terms of illness localization.</p></details> |  |

SCC grading using whole slide images is inherently challenging due to the lack of a reliable protocol and substantial tissue heterogeneity. We propose RACR-MIL, the first weakly-supervised SCC grading approach achieving robust generalization across multiple anatomies (skin, head and neck, lung). RACR-MIL is an attention-based multiple-instance learning framework that enhances grade-relevant contextual representation learning and addresses tumor heterogeneity through two key innovations: (1) a hybrid WSI graph that captures both local tissue context and non-local phenotypical dependencies between tumor regions, and (2) a rank-ordering constraint in the attention mechanism that consistently prioritizes higher-grade tumor regions, aligning with pathologists diagnostic process. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple SCC datasets, achieving 3-9% higher grading accuracy, resilience to class imbalance, and up to 16% improved tumor localization. In a pilot study, pathologists reported that RACR-MIL improved grading efficiency in 60% of cases, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable cancer diagnosis and grading assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages main text, 2 page references, 2 page appendix; under submission</p></details> |

Accurate detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs, especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments, reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and 98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

However, their general-purpose design can limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models poses challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

However, most MIL models only offer attention-based explanations that do not faithfully capture the model's decision mechanism and do not allow human-model interaction. To address these limitations, we introduce ProtoMIL, an inherently interpretable MIL model for WSI analysis that offers user-friendly explanations and supports human intervention. Our approach employs a sparse autoencoder to discover human-interpretable concepts from the image feature space, which are then used to train ProtoMIL. The model represents predictions as linear combinations of concepts, making the decision process transparent. Furthermore, ProtoMIL allows users to perform model interventions by altering the input concepts. Experiments on two widely used pathology datasets demonstrate that ProtoMIL achieves a classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art MIL models while offering intuitively understandable explanations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can eliminate reliance on diagnostically irrelevant information via human intervention, guiding the model toward being right for the right reason.

This is usually the case in digital pathology, which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing \textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty. SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across both bag- and instance-level evaluations.

| **[Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08178v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors.

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569 for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for microscopy based patient diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images, leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16 \times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256 \times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling, and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distilling High Diagnostic Value Patches for Whole Slide Image Classification Using Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19821v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has garnered widespread attention in the field of Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification as it replaces pixel-level manual annotation with diagnostic reports as labels, significantly reducing labor costs. Recent research has shown that bag-level MIL methods often yield better results because they can consider all patches of the WSI as a whole. However, a drawback of such methods is the incorporation of more redundant patches, leading to interference. To extract patches with high diagnostic value while excluding interfering patches to address this issue, we developed an attention-based feature distillation multi-instance learning (AFD-MIL) approach. This approach proposed the exclusion of redundant patches as a preprocessing operation in weakly supervised learning, directly mitigating interference from extensive noise. It also pioneers the use of attention mechanisms to distill features with high diagnostic value, as opposed to the traditional practice of indiscriminately and forcibly integrating all patches. Additionally, we introduced global loss optimization to finely control the feature distillation module. AFD-MIL is orthogonal to many existing MIL methods, leading to consistent performance improvements. This approach has surpassed the current state-of-the-art method, achieving 91.47% ACC (accuracy) and 94.29% AUC (area under the curve) on the Camelyon16 (Camelyon Challenge 2016, breast cancer), while 93.33% ACC and 98.17% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC (The Cancer Genome Atlas Program: non-small cell lung cancer). Different feature distillation methods were used for the two datasets, tailored to the specific diseases, thereby improving performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Establishing Causal Relationship Between Whole Slide Image Predictions and Diagnostic Evidence Subregions in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17157v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the lack of fine-grained annotation guidance, current Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) struggles to establish a robust causal relationship between Whole Slide Image (WSI) diagnosis and evidence sub-images, just like fully supervised learning. So many noisy images can undermine the network's prediction. The proposed Causal Inference Multiple Instance Learning (CI-MIL), uses out-of-distribution generalization to reduce the recognition confusion of sub-images by MIL network, without requiring pixelwise annotations. Specifically, feature distillation is introduced to roughly identify the feature representation of lesion patches. Then, in the random Fourier feature space, these features are re-weighted to minimize the cross-correlation, effectively correcting the feature distribution deviation. These processes reduce the uncertainty when tracing the prediction results back to patches. Predicted diagnoses are more direct and reliable because the causal relationship between them and diagnostic evidence images is more clearly recognized by the network. Experimental results demonstrate that CI-MIL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.25% accuracy and 95.28% AUC on the Camelyon16 dataset (breast cancer), while 94.29% accuracy and 98.07% AUC on the TCGA-NSCLC dataset (non-small cell lung cancer). Additionally, CI-MIL exhibits superior interpretability, as its selected regions demonstrate high consistency with ground truth annotations, promising more reliable diagnostic assistance for pathologists.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Variability of Multiple Instance Learning Methods for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00292v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a (too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15 AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>MICCA...</summary><p>MICCAI 2025 - This preprint has not undergone peer review or any post-submission improvements or corrections.

Although AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly, we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748 images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors.

Building on this insight, we integrate AEM regularization into the MIL framework to penalize excessive attention concentration. To address sensitivity to the AEM weight parameter, we implement Cosine Weight Annealing, reducing parameter dependency.

WSIs exhibit a natural hierarchy -- patches, regions, and slides -- with distinct semantic associations. While some methods attempt to leverage this hierarchy for improved representation, they predominantly rely on Euclidean embeddings, which struggle to fully capture semantic hierarchies. To address this limitation, we propose HyperPath, a novel method that integrates knowledge from textual descriptions to guide the modeling of semantic hierarchies of WSIs in hyperbolic space, thereby enhancing WSI classification. Our approach adapts both visual and textual features extracted by pathology vision-language foundation models to the hyperbolic space. We design an Angular Modality Alignment Loss to ensure robust cross-modal alignment, while a Semantic Hierarchy Consistency Loss further refines feature hierarchies through entailment and contradiction relationships and thus enhance semantic coherence. The classification is performed with geodesic distance, which measures the similarity between entities in the hyperbolic semantic hierarchy. This eliminates the need for linear classifiers and enables a geometry-aware approach to WSI analysis. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance across tasks compared to existing methods, highlighting the potential of hyperbolic embeddings for WSI analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[OTSurv: A Novel Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Survival Prediction with Heterogeneity-aware Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20741v2)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival prediction using whole slide images (WSIs) can be formulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. However, existing MIL methods often fail to explicitly capture pathological heterogeneity within WSIs, both globally -- through long-tailed morphological distributions, and locally through -- tile-level prediction uncertainty. Optimal transport (OT) provides a principled way of modeling such heterogeneity by incorporating marginal distribution constraints. Building on this insight, we propose OTSurv, a novel MIL framework from an optimal transport perspective. Specifically, OTSurv formulates survival predictions as a heterogeneity-aware OT problem with two constraints: (1) global long-tail constraint that models prior morphological distributions to avert both mode collapse and excessive uniformity by regulating transport mass allocation, and (2) local uncertainty-aware constraint that prioritizes high-confidence patches while suppressing noise by progressively raising the total transport mass. We then recast the initial OT problem, augmented by these constraints, into an unbalanced OT formulation that can be solved with an efficient, hardware-friendly matrix scaling algorithm. Empirically, OTSurv sets new state-of-the-art results across six popular benchmarks, achieving an absolute 3.6% improvement in average C-index. In addition, OTSurv achieves statistical significance in log-rank tests and offers high interpretability, making it a powerful tool for survival prediction in digital pathology.

However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering (MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Alternatively, learning fine-grained visual representation from enormous unlabeled images (e.g., species, brands) by self-supervised learning becomes a feasible solution. However, recent researches find that existing self-supervised learning methods are less qualified to represent fine-grained categories. The bottleneck lies in that the pre-text representation is built from every patch-wise embedding, while fine-grained categories are only determined by several key patches of an image. In this paper, we propose a Cross-level Multi-instance Distillation (CMD) framework to tackle the challenge. Our key idea is to consider the importance of each image patch in determining the fine-grained pre-text representation by multiple instance learning. To comprehensively learn the relation between informative patches and fine-grained semantics, the multi-instance knowledge distillation is implemented on both the region/image crop pairs from the teacher and student net, and the region-image crops inside the teacher / student net, which we term as intra-level multi-instance distillation and inter-level multi-instance distillation. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC Aircraft show that the proposed method outperforms the contemporary method by upto 10.14% and existing state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches by upto 19.78% on both top-1 accuracy and Rank-1 retrieval metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP)</p></details> |

In computational pathology, automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL) frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model - Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts.

However, MIL often struggles with small, weakly supervised clinical datasets. In contrast to fields such as NLP and conventional computer vision, where transfer learning is widely used to address data scarcity, the transferability of MIL models remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically evaluate the transfer learning capabilities of pretrained MIL models by assessing 11 models across 21 pretraining tasks for morphological and molecular subtype prediction. Our results show that pretrained MIL models, even when trained on different organs than the target task, consistently outperform models trained from scratch. Moreover, pretraining on pancancer datasets enables strong generalization across organs and tasks, outperforming slide foundation models while using substantially less pretraining data. These findings highlight the robust adaptability of MIL models and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging transfer learning to boost performance in CPath.

Motivated by the central dogma of molecular biology (information flow from gene to transcript to protein), we align per-modality embeddings at the biologically meaningful codon level (three nucleotides encoding one amino acid) to ensure direct cross-modal correspondence. BioLangFusion studies three standard fusion techniques: (i) codon-level embedding concatenation, (ii) entropy-regularized attention pooling inspired by multiple-instance learning, and (iii) cross-modal multi-head attention -- each technique providing a different inductive bias for combining modality-specific signals. These methods require no additional pre-training or modification of the base models, allowing straightforward integration with existing sequence-based foundation models. Across five molecular property prediction tasks, BioLangFusion outperforms strong unimodal baselines, showing that even simple fusion of pre-trained models can capture complementary multi-omic information with minimal overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-modal Foundation Proceedings of ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-modal Foundation Proceedings of ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-modal Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Life Sciences</p></details> |
| **[Single GPU Task Adaptation of Pathology Foundation Models for Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05184v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing whole slide images (WSIs). However, adapting these pretrained PFMs for specific clinical tasks presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the availability of only weak (WSI-level) labels for gigapixel images, necessitating multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm for effective WSI analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach for single-GPU \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}daptation of \textbf{PFM}s (TAPFM) that uses vision transformer (\vit) attention for MIL aggregation while optimizing both for feature representations and attention weights. The proposed approach maintains separate computational graphs for MIL aggregator and the PFM to create stable training dynamics that align with downstream task objectives during end-to-end adaptation. Evaluated on mutation prediction tasks for bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma across institutional and TCGA cohorts, TAPFM consistently outperforms conventional approaches, with H-Optimus-0 (TAPFM) outperforming the benchmarks. TAPFM effectively handles multi-label classification of actionable mutations as well. Thus, TAPFM makes adaptation of powerful pre-trained PFMs practical on standard hardware for various clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[DLiPath: A Benchmark for the Comprehensive Assessment of Donor Liver Based on Histopathological Image Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03185v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research.

This makes it difficult to not only collect consistent annotations across a dataset but also to validate them, as no two annotators are likely to label the same object using the exact same coordinates. These challenges are further compounded when object boundaries are partially visible or blurred, which can be the case in many domains. Training on noisy annotations significantly degrades detector performance, rendering them unusable, particularly in few-shot settings, where just a few corrupted annotations can impact model performance. In this work, we propose FMG-Det, a simple, efficient methodology for training models with noisy annotations. More specifically, we propose combining a multiple instance learning (MIL) framework with a pre-processing pipeline that leverages powerful foundation models to correct labels prior to training. This pre-processing pipeline, along with slight modifications to the detector head, results in state-of-the-art performance across a number of datasets, for both standard and few-shot scenarios, while being much simpler and more efficient than other approaches.</p></details> | 10 pages, ICIP 2025 |

Here, we compare the performance of two machine learning models - FMCIB+XGBoost, a supervised model with domain-specific pretraining, and Dinov2+ABMIL, a self-supervised model with attention-based multiple-instance learning - on 3D lung nodule data from the Stanford Radiogenomics and Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohorts. In the task of KRAS and EGFR mutation detection, FMCIB+XGBoost consistently outperformed Dinov2+ABMIL, achieving accuracies of 0.846 and 0.883 for KRAS and EGFR mutations, respectively. In cancer staging, Dinov2+ABMIL demonstrated competitive generalization, achieving an accuracy of 0.797 for T-stage prediction in the Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohort, suggesting SSL's adaptability across diverse datasets. Our results emphasize the clinical utility of supervised models in mutation detection and highlight the potential of SSL to improve staging generalization, while identifying areas for enhancement in mutation sensitivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising Mutual Knowledge Distillation in Bi-Directional Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12074v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning is the predominant method for Whole Slide Image classification in digital pathology, enabling the use of slide-level labels to supervise model training. Although MIL eliminates the tedious fine-grained annotation process for supervised learning, whether it can learn accurate bag- and instance-level classifiers remains a question. To address the issue, instance-level classifiers and instance masks were incorporated to ground the prediction on supporting patches. These methods, while practically improving the performance of MIL methods, may potentially introduce noisy labels. We propose to bridge the gap between commonly used MIL and fully supervised learning by augmenting both the bag- and instance-level learning processes with pseudo-label correction capabilities elicited from weak to strong generalization techniques. The proposed algorithm improves the performance of dual-level MIL algorithms on both bag- and instance-level predictions. Experiments on public pathology datasets showcase the advantage of the proposed methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |

The input features to the models often have a nested structure that consists of high- and low-level features, and each high-level feature is decomposed into multiple low-level features. For such inputs, both high-level feature attributions (HiFAs) and low-level feature attributions (LoFAs) are important for better understanding the model's decision. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic local explanation method that effectively exploits the nested structure of the input to estimate the two-level feature attributions simultaneously. A key idea of the proposed method is to introduce the consistency property that should exist between the HiFAs and LoFAs, thereby bridging the separate optimization problems for estimating them. Thanks to this consistency property, the proposed method can produce HiFAs and LoFAs that are both faithful to the black-box models and consistent with each other, using a smaller number of queries to the models. In experiments on image classification in multiple instance learning and text classification using language models, we demonstrate that the HiFAs and LoFAs estimated by the proposed method are accurate, faithful to the behaviors of the black-box models, and provide consistent explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is an extended version of our paper accepted at IJCAI2025, with detailed proofs and additional experimental results</p></details> |
| **[Self-Classification Enhancement and Correction for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16294v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted much attention due to its low labeling cost. The success of recent WSOD models is often ascribed to the two-stage multi-class classification (MCC) task, i.e., multiple instance learning and online classification refinement. Despite achieving non-trivial progresses, these methods overlook potential classification ambiguities between these two MCC tasks and fail to leverage their unique strengths. In this work, we introduce a novel WSOD framework to ameliorate these two issues. For one thing, we propose a self-classification enhancement module that integrates intra-class binary classification (ICBC) to bridge the gap between the two distinct MCC tasks. The ICBC task enhances the network's discrimination between positive and mis-located samples in a class-wise manner and forges a mutually reinforcing relationship with the MCC task. For another, we propose a self-classification correction algorithm during inference, which combines the results of both MCC tasks to effectively reduce the mis-classified predictions. Extensive experiments on the prevalent VOC 2007 & 2012 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Linearity: Squeeze-and-Recalibrate Blocks for Few-Shot Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15504v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has advanced computational pathology but expert annotations remain scarce. Few-shot learning mitigates annotation burdens yet suffers from overfitting and discriminative feature mischaracterization. In addition, the current few-shot multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches leverage pretrained vision-language models to alleviate these issues, but at the cost of complex preprocessing and high computational cost. We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SR-MIL models consistently outperform prior methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters and no architectural changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Pathology Foundation Model: Progress and Future Directions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04045v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for automated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where performance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology data, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they lack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical taxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation model analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design. Additionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into slide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing comprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical challenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end pretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation, model maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising field.

| **[How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14783v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/MILDropout.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2025 |

However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL: Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or ``pseudo-bags'' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods. This work provides a foundation for CL in large-scale, weakly annotated clinical datasets, paving the way for more adaptable and resilient diagnostic models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To address this challenge, we propose an Attention-based Generative Latent Replay Continual Learning framework (AGLR-CL), in a multiple instance learning (MIL) setup for domain incremental WSI classification. Our method employs Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to synthesize WSI representations and patch count distributions, preserving knowledge of past domains without explicitly storing original data. A novel attention-based filtering step focuses on the most salient patch embeddings, ensuring high-quality synthetic samples. This privacy-aware strategy obviates the need for replay buffers and outperforms other buffer-free counterparts while matching the performance of buffer-based solutions. We validate AGLR-CL on clinically relevant biomarker detection and molecular status prediction across multiple public datasets with diverse centers, organs, and patient cohorts. Experimental results confirm its ability to retain prior knowledge and adapt to new domains, offering an effective, privacy-preserving avenue for domain incremental continual learning in WSI classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervision Enhances Instance-based Multiple Instance Learning Methods in Digital Pathology: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01109v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as the best solution for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. It consists of dividing each slide into patches, which are treated as a bag of instances labeled with a global label. MIL includes two main approaches: instance-based and embedding-based. In the former, each patch is classified independently, and then the patch scores are aggregated to predict the bag label. In the latter, bag classification is performed after aggregating patch embeddings. Even if instance-based methods are naturally more interpretable, embedding-based MILs have usually been preferred in the past due to their robustness to poor feature extractors. However, recently, the quality of feature embeddings has drastically increased using self-supervised learning (SSL). Nevertheless, many authors continue to endorse the superiority of embedding-based MIL. To investigate this further, we conduct 710 experiments across 4 datasets, comparing 10 MIL strategies, 6 self-supervised methods with 4 backbones, 4 foundation models, and various pathology-adapted techniques. Furthermore, we introduce 4 instance-based MIL methods never used before in the pathology domain. Through these extensive experiments, we show that with a good SSL feature extractor, simple instance-based MILs, with very few parameters, obtain similar or better performance than complex, state-of-the-art (SOTA) embedding-based MIL methods, setting new SOTA results on the BRACS and Camelyon16 datasets. Since simple instance-based MIL methods are naturally more interpretable and explainable to clinicians, our results suggest that more effort should be put into well-adapted SSL methods for WSI rather than into complex embedding-based MIL methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Medical Imaging (SPIE)</p></details> |
| **[A Spatially-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Framework for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17379v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising approach for weakly supervised classification in pathology using whole slide images (WSIs). However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

In many real-world applications, modeling both the internal structure of sets and their temporal relationships across time is essential for capturing complex underlying patterns. However, existing methods either focus on learning set representations at a static level, ignoring temporal dynamics, or treat sequences as ordered lists of individual elements, lacking explicit mechanisms to represent sets. In this work, we propose Set2Seq Transformer, a novel architecture that jointly models permutation-invariant set structure and temporal dependencies by learning temporal and positional-aware representations of sets within a sequence in an end-to-end multimodal manner. We evaluate our Set2Seq Transformer on two tasks that require modeling both set structure alongside temporal and positional patterns, but differ significantly in domain, modality, and objective. First, we consider a fine-art analysis task, modeling artists' oeuvres for predicting artistic success using a novel dataset, WikiArt-Seq2Rank. Second, we utilize our Set2Seq Transformer for a short-term wildfire danger forecasting task. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our Set2Seq Transformer significantly improves over traditional static multiple-instance learning methods by effectively learning permutation-invariant set, temporal, and positional-aware representations across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. We will release both the dataset and model implementations on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRASP: GRAph-Structured Pyramidal Whole Slide Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03592v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer subtyping is one of the most challenging tasks in digital pathology, where Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) by processing gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) has been in the spotlight of recent research. However, MIL approaches do not take advantage of inter- and intra-magnification information contained in WSIs. In this work, we present GRASP, a novel lightweight graph-structured multi-magnification framework for processing WSIs in digital pathology. Our approach is designed to dynamically emulate the pathologist's behavior in handling WSIs and benefits from the hierarchical structure of WSIs. GRASP, which introduces a convergence-based node aggregation mechanism replacing traditional pooling mechanisms, outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a high margin in terms of balanced accuracy, while being significantly smaller than the closest-performing state-of-the-art models in terms of the number of parameters. Our results show that GRASP is dynamic in finding and consulting with different magnifications for subtyping cancers, is reliable and stable across different hyperparameters, and can generalize when using features from different backbones. The model's behavior has been evaluated by two expert pathologists confirming the interpretability of the model's dynamic. We also provide a theoretical foundation, along with empirical evidence, for our work, explaining how GRASP interacts with different magnifications and nodes in the graph to make predictions. We believe that the strong characteristics yet simple structure of GRASP will encourage the development of interpretable, structure-based designs for WSI representation in digital pathology.

However, the development of robust deep learning models for digital cytology is challenging due to the heterogeneity in staining and preparation methods of samples, differences across organs, and the limited availability of large, diverse, annotated datasets. Developing a task-specific model for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific foundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the emphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce CytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model. Using iBOT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) training framework incorporating masked image modeling and self-distillation, we pretrain CytoFM on a diverse collection of cytology datasets to learn robust, transferable representations. We evaluate CytoFM on multiple downstream cytology tasks, including breast cancer classification and cell type identification, using an attention-based multiple instance learning framework. Our results demonstrate that CytoFM performs better on two out of three downstream tasks than existing foundation models pretrained on histopathology (UNI) or natural images (iBOT-Imagenet). Visualizations of learned representations demonstrate our model is able to attend to cytologically relevant features. Despite a small pre-training dataset, CytoFM's promising results highlight the ability of task-agnostic pre-training approaches to learn robust and generalizable features from cytology data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Semi-supervised Whole Slide Image Classification by Two-level Cross Consistency Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12132v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has the potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of clinical pathological diagnosis. It is commonly formulated as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where each WSI is treated as a bag and the small patches extracted from the WSI are considered instances within that bag. However, obtaining labels for a large number of bags is a costly and time-consuming process, particularly when utilizing existing WSIs for new classification tasks. This limitation renders most existing WSI classification methods ineffective. To address this issue, we propose a novel WSI classification problem setting, more aligned with clinical practice, termed Weakly Semi-supervised Whole slide image Classification (WSWC). In WSWC, a small number of bags are labeled, while a significant number of bags remain unlabeled. The MIL nature of the WSWC problem, coupled with the absence of patch labels, distinguishes it from typical semi-supervised image classification problems, making existing algorithms for natural images unsuitable for directly solving the WSWC problem. In this paper, we present a concise and efficient framework, named CroCo, to tackle the WSWC problem through two-level Cross Consistency supervision. CroCo comprises two heterogeneous classifier branches capable of performing both instance classification and bag classification. The fundamental idea is to establish cross-consistency supervision at both the bag-level and instance-level between the two branches during training. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that CroCo achieves superior bag classification and instance classification performance compared to other comparative methods when limited WSIs with bag labels are available. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents for the first time the WSWC problem and gives a successful resolution.</p></details> |  |

While immune cells play a key role in IBD, accurately identifying ulcer regions in whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for characterizing these cells and exploring potential therapeutics. Multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches have advanced WSI analysis but they lack spatial context awareness. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised model called DomainGCN that employs a graph convolution neural network (GCN) and incorporates domain-specific knowledge of ulcer features, specifically, the presence of epithelium, lymphocytes, and debris for WSI-level ulcer prediction in IBD.

However, the performance gap compared with fully-supervised algorithms remains large. Previous works generated class-agnostic \textbf{\textit{proposals in an image}} offline and then treated mixed candidates as a single bag, putting a huge burden on multiple instance learning (MIL). In this paper, we introduce Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which constructs balanced \textbf{\textit{instance-level proposal bags}} by generating proposals in an anchor-like way and refining the proposals in a coarse-to-fine paradigm. Through further research, we find that the bag of proposals, either at the image level or the instance level, is established on discrete box sampling. This leads the pseudo box estimation into a sub-optimal solution, resulting in the truncation of object boundaries or the excessive inclusion of background. Hence, we conduct a series exploration of discrete-to-continuous optimization, yielding P2BNet++ and Point-to-Mask Network (P2MNet). P2BNet++ conducts an approximately continuous proposal sampling strategy by better utilizing spatial clues. P2MNet further introduces low-level image information to assist in pixel prediction, and a boundary self-prediction is designed to relieve the limitation of the estimated boxes. Benefiting from the continuous object-aware \textbf{\textit{pixel-level perception}}, P2MNet can generate more precise bounding boxes and generalize to segmentation tasks. Our method largely surpasses the previous methods in terms of the mean average precision on COCO, VOC, SBD, and Cityscapes, demonstrating great potential to bridge the performance gap compared with fully supervised tasks.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCV |

Especially for adolescents, delayed detection and treatment result in worsening compression. Traditional scoliosis detection methods heavily rely on clinical expertise, and X-ray imaging poses radiation risks, limiting large-scale early screening. We propose an Attention-Guided Deep Multi-Instance Learning method (Gait-MIL) to effectively capture discriminative features from gait patterns, which is inspired by ScoNet-MT's pioneering use of gait patterns for scoliosis detection. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale dataset based on gait patterns for scoliosis classification. The results demonstrate that our study improves the performance of using gait as a biomarker for scoliosis detection, significantly enhances detection accuracy for the particularly challenging Neutral cases, where subtle indicators are often overlooked. Our Gait-MIL also performs robustly in imbalanced scenarios, making it a promising tool for large-scale scoliosis screening.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While recent multimodal MIL pretraining approaches leveraging auxiliary modalities have demonstrated performance gains over unimodal WSI pretraining, the acquisition of these additional modalities necessitates extensive clinical profiling. This requirement increases costs and limits scalability in existing WSI datasets lacking such paired modalities. To address this, we propose Gigapixel Vision-Concept Knowledge Contrastive pretraining (GECKO), which aligns WSIs with a Concept Prior derived from the available WSIs. First, we derive an inherently interpretable concept prior by computing the similarity between each WSI patch and textual descriptions of predefined pathology concepts. GECKO then employs a dual-branch MIL network: one branch aggregates patch embeddings into a WSI-level deep embedding, while the other aggregates the concept prior into a corresponding WSI-level concept embedding. Both aggregated embeddings are aligned using a contrastive objective, thereby pretraining the entire dual-branch MIL model. Moreover, when auxiliary modalities such as transcriptomics data are available, GECKO seamlessly integrates them. Across five diverse tasks, GECKO consistently outperforms prior unimodal and multimodal pretraining approaches while also delivering clinically meaningful interpretability that bridges the gap between computational models and pathology expertise.

| **[MIL vs. Aggregation: Evaluating Patient-Level Survival Prediction Strategies Using Graph-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23042v1)** | 2025-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oncologists often rely on a multitude of data, including whole-slide images (WSIs), to guide therapeutic decisions, aiming for the best patient outcome. However, predicting the prognosis of cancer patients can be a challenging task due to tumor heterogeneity and intra-patient variability, and the complexity of analyzing WSIs. These images are extremely large, containing billions of pixels, making direct processing computationally expensive and requiring specialized methods to extract relevant information. Additionally, multiple WSIs from the same patient may capture different tumor regions, some being more informative than others. This raises a fundamental question: Should we use all WSIs to characterize the patient, or should we identify the most representative slide for prognosis? Our work seeks to answer this question by performing a comparison of various strategies for predicting survival at the WSI and patient level. The former treats each WSI as an independent sample, mimicking the strategy adopted in other works, while the latter comprises methods to either aggregate the predictions of the several WSIs or automatically identify the most relevant slide using multiple-instance learning (MIL). Additionally, we evaluate different Graph Neural Networks architectures under these strategies. We conduct our experiments using the MMIST-ccRCC dataset, which comprises patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Our results show that MIL-based selection improves accuracy, suggesting that choosing the most representative slide benefits survival prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies develop high-quality patch feature extractors and employ carefully designed aggregation schemes to derive slide-level representations. However, mainstream weakly supervised slide representation learning methods, primarily based on multiple instance learning (MIL), are tailored to specific downstream tasks, which limits their generalizability. To address this issue, some studies explore unsupervised slide representation learning. However, these approaches focus solely on the visual modality of patches, neglecting the rich semantic information embedded in textual data. In this work, we propose ProAlign, a cross-modal unsupervised slide representation learning framework. Specifically, we leverage a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive text for the prototype types present in a WSI, introducing patch-text contrast to construct initial prototype embeddings. Furthermore, we propose a parameter-free attention aggregation strategy that utilizes the similarity between patches and these prototypes to form unsupervised slide embeddings applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that ProAlign outperforms existing unsupervised frameworks and achieves performance comparable to some weakly supervised models.</p></details> | 11pages,3 figures |

However, diagnostic models often face the challenge of forgetting previously learned data during incremental training on datasets from different sources. To address this issue, we propose a new framework PaGMIL to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in breast cancer WSI classification. Our framework introduces two key components into the common MIL model architecture. First, it leverages microscopic pathological prior to select more accurate and diverse representative patches for MIL. Secondly, it trains separate classification heads for each task and uses macroscopic pathological prior knowledge, treating the thumbnail as a prompt guide (PG) to select the appropriate classification head. We evaluate the continual learning performance of PaGMIL across several public breast cancer datasets. PaGMIL achieves a better balance between the performance of the current task and the retention of previous tasks, outperforming other continual learning methods. Our code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.</p></details> | ICASSP2025(Oral) |

Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. To overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM synthesizes coherent histopathology images that remain contextually accurate and detailed at different zoom levels, achieving state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales and excelling in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments.</p></details> |  |

This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.4% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors.

Given the gigapixel scale of WSIs, conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) methods rely on aggregation functions to derive slide-level (bag-level) predictions from patch representations, which require extensive bag-level labels for training. In contrast, VLM-based approaches excel at aligning visual embeddings of patches with candidate class text prompts but lack essential pathological prior knowledge. Our method distinguishes itself by utilizing pathological prior knowledge from language models to identify crucial local tissue types (patches) for WSI classification, integrating this within a VLM-based MIL framework. Our approach effectively aligns patch images with tissue types, and we fine-tune our model via prompt learning using only a few labeled WSIs per category. Experimentation on real-world pathological WSI datasets and ablation studies highlight our method's superior performance over existing MIL- and VLM-based methods in few-shot WSI classification tasks.

However, most weakly supervised methods either involve a strong downsampling of input images, or only achieve localization at a coarse resolution, both of which are unsatisfactory for small structures. We propose a novel framework that increases the spatial resolution of a traditional attention-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach by using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to prompt the Segment Anything Model (SAM~2), and increases recall with iterative inference. Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing MIL with a Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT), which adds a positional encoding, and permits an exchange of information between different regions of the OCT image, leads to a further and substantial increase in segmentation accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, accepted at German Conference on Medical Image Computing 2025</p></details> |

Pathologists currently rely on time consuming manual assessments, which are highly subjective and prone to variation. This highlights the urgent need for automated and precise diag nostic solutions. 2,970 lung cancer tissue slides are comprised from multiple centers, re-diagnosed them, and constructed and publicly released three lung cancer STAS datasets: STAS CSU (hospital), STAS TCGA, and STAS CPTAC. All STAS datasets provide corresponding pathological feature diagnoses and related clinical data. To address the bias, sparse and heterogeneous nature of STAS, we propose an scale-aware multiple instance learning(SMILE) method for STAS diagnosis of lung cancer. By introducing a scale-adaptive attention mechanism, the SMILE can adaptively adjust high attention instances, reducing over-reliance on local regions and promoting consistent detection of STAS lesions. Extensive experiments show that SMILE achieved competitive diagnostic results on STAS CSU, diagnosing 251 and 319 STAS samples in CPTAC andTCGA,respectively, surpassing clinical average AUC. The 11 open baseline results are the first to be established for STAS research, laying the foundation for the future expansion, interpretability, and clinical integration of computational pathology technologies.

Traditional microbiological methods are time-consuming and expensive. In response to these challenges, deep learning algorithms were developed to identify 14 bacteria species and 3 yeast-like fungi from microscopic images of Gram-stained smears of positive blood samples from sepsis patients. A total of 16,637 Gram-stained microscopic images were used in the study. The analysis used the Cellpose 3 model for segmentation and Attention-based Deep Multiple Instance Learning for classification. Our model achieved an accuracy of 77.15% for bacteria and 71.39% for fungi, with ROC AUC of 0.97 and 0.88, respectively. The highest values, reaching up to 96.2%, were obtained for Cutibacterium acnes, Enterococcus faecium, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Nakaseomyces glabratus. Classification difficulties were observed in closely related species, such as Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, due to morphological similarity, and within Candida albicans due to high morphotic diversity. The study confirms the potential of our model for microbial classification, but it also indicates the need for further optimisation and expansion of the training data set. In the future, this technology could support microbial diagnosis, reducing diagnostic time and improving the effectiveness of sepsis treatment due to its simplicity and accessibility. Part of the results presented in this publication was covered by a patent application at the European Patent Office EP24461637.1 "A computer implemented method for identifying a microorganism in a blood and a data processing system therefor".</p></details> |  |

Standard compression methods, such as JPEG, reduce file sizes but often fail to preserve fine-grained phenotypic details critical for downstream tasks. In this work, we repurpose autoencoders (AEs) designed for Latent Diffusion Models as an efficient learned compression framework for pathology images. We systematically benchmark three AE models with varying compression levels and evaluate their reconstruction ability using pathology foundation models. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy to further enhance reconstruction fidelity that optimizes a pathology-specific learned perceptual metric. We validate our approach on downstream tasks, including segmentation, patch classification, and multiple instance learning, showing that replacing images with AE-compressed reconstructions leads to minimal performance degradation. Additionally, we propose a K-means clustering-based quantization method for AE latents, improving storage efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality. We provide the weights of the fine-tuned autoencoders at https://huggingface.co/collections/StonyBrook-CVLab/pathology-fine-tuned-aes-67d45f223a659ff2e3402dd0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aligning First, Then Fusing: A Novel Weakly Supervised Multimodal Violence Detection Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07496v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised violence detection refers to the technique of training models to identify violent segments in videos using only video-level labels. Among these approaches, multimodal violence detection, which integrates modalities such as audio and optical flow, holds great potential. Existing methods in this domain primarily focus on designing multimodal fusion models to address modality discrepancies. In contrast, we take a different approach; leveraging the inherent discrepancies across modalities in violence event representation to propose a novel multimodal semantic feature alignment method. This method sparsely maps the semantic features of local, transient, and less informative modalities ( such as audio and optical flow ) into the more informative RGB semantic feature space. Through an iterative process, the method identifies the suitable no-zero feature matching subspace and aligns the modality-specific event representations based on this subspace, enabling the full exploitation of information from all modalities during the subsequent modality fusion stage. Building on this, we design a new weakly supervised violence detection framework that consists of unimodal multiple-instance learning for extracting unimodal semantic features, multimodal alignment, multimodal fusion, and final detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an average precision (AP) of 86.07% on the XD-Violence dataset.

Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods adopt a segmented training strategy, which first extracts features using a pre-trained feature extractor and then aggregates these features through MIL. This segmented training approach leads to insufficient collaborative optimization between the feature extraction network and the MIL network, preventing end-to-end joint optimization and thereby limiting the overall performance of the model. Additionally, conventional methods typically extract features from all patches of fixed size, ignoring the multi-scale observation characteristics of pathologists. This not only results in significant computational resource waste when tumor regions represent a minimal proportion (as in the Camelyon16 dataset) but may also lead the model to suboptimal solutions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end multi-scale WSI classification framework that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with multiple instance learning. Specifically, our approach includes: (1) a semantic feature filtering module to reduce interference from non-lesion areas; (2) a multi-scale feature extraction module to capture pathological information at different levels; and (3) a multi-scale fusion MIL module for global modeling and feature integration. Through an end-to-end training strategy, we simultaneously optimize both the feature extractor and MIL network, ensuring maximum compatibility between them. Experiments were conducted on three cross-center datasets (DigestPath2019, BCNB, and UBC-OCEAN). Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy (ACC) and AUC metrics.</p></details> | summited to ICCV2025 |

Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models. Furthermore, this work may inform the development of more effective pathology foundation models.

The quick start of the treatment process is critical to saving the patient's life, and for this reason, early diagnosis of this disease is essential. Examining the blood smear images of these patients is one of the methods used by expert doctors to diagnose this disease. Deep learning-based methods have numerous applications in medical fields, as they have significantly advanced in recent years. ALL diagnosis is not an exception in this field, and several machine learning-based methods for this problem have been proposed. In previous methods, high diagnostic accuracy was reported, but our work showed that this alone is not sufficient, as it can lead to models taking shortcuts and not making meaningful decisions. This issue arises due to the small size of medical training datasets. To address this, we constrained our model to follow a pipeline inspired by experts' work. We also demonstrated that, since a judgement based on only one image is insufficient, redefining the problem as a multiple-instance learning problem is necessary for achieving a practical result. Our model is the first to provide a solution to this problem in a multiple-instance learning setup. We introduced a novel pipeline for diagnosing ALL that approximates the process used by hematologists, is sensitive to disease biomarkers, and achieves an accuracy of 96.15%, an F1-score of 94.24%, a sensitivity of 97.56%, and a specificity of 90.91% on ALL IDB 1. Our method was further evaluated on an out-of-distribution dataset, which posed a challenging test and had acceptable performance. Notably, our model was trained on a relatively small dataset, highlighting the potential for our approach to be applied to other medical datasets with limited data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models -- A Panacea for Artificial Intelligence in Pathology?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21264v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in pathology has evolved from aiding diagnostics to uncovering predictive morphological patterns in whole slide images (WSIs). Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |

The field of WSI analysis is confronted with a severe long-tailed distribution problem, which significantly impacts the performance of classifiers. Long-tailed distributions lead to class imbalance, where some classes have sparse samples while others are abundant, making it difficult for classifiers to accurately identify minority class samples. To address this issue, we propose an ensemble learning method based on MIL, which employs expert decoders with shared aggregators and consistency constraints to learn diverse distributions and reduce the impact of class imbalance on classifier performance. Moreover, we introduce a multimodal distillation framework that leverages text encoders pre-trained on pathology-text pairs to distill knowledge and guide the MIL aggregator in capturing stronger semantic features relevant to class information. To ensure flexibility, we use learnable prompts to guide the distillation process of the pre-trained text encoder, avoiding limitations imposed by specific prompts. Our method, MDE-MIL, integrates multiple expert branches focusing on specific data distributions to address long-tailed issues. Consistency control ensures generalization across classes. Multimodal distillation enhances feature extraction. Experiments on Camelyon+-LT and PANDA-LT datasets show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has emerged as a widely used approach for weakly-supervised tumor detection with large-scale data without the need for manual annotations. However, traditional MIL methods often depend on classification tasks that require tumor-free cases as negative examples, which are challenging to obtain in real-world clinical workflows, especially for surgical resection specimens. We address this limitation by reformulating tumor detection as a regression task, estimating tumor percentages from WSIs, a clinically available target across multiple cancer types. In this paper, we provide an analysis of the proposed weakly-supervised regression framework by applying it to multiple organs, specimen types and clinical scenarios. We characterize the robustness of our framework to tumor percentage as a noisy regression target, and introduce a novel concept of amplification technique to improve tumor detection sensitivity when learning from small tumor regions. Finally, we provide interpretable insights into the model's predictions by analyzing visual attention and logit maps. Our code is available at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/tumor-percentage-mil-regression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Simplify Slide-level Fine-tuning of Pathology Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20823v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis being a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via multiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting foundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental finding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level foundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning. Through extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular MIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in few-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level foundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP exhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning paradigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can effectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a unique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology, paving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

There is high heterogeneity in tissue appearance, significant class imbalance in favor of benign examples, and scarcity in the number and quality of ground truth annotations available to train models. Failure to address even a single one of these problems can result in unacceptable clinical outcomes.We propose TRUSWorthy, a carefully designed, tuned, and integrated system for reliable PCa detection. Our pipeline integrates self-supervised learning, multiple-instance learning aggregation using transformers, random-undersampled boosting and ensembling: these address label scarcity, weak labels, class imbalance, and overconfidence, respectively. We train and rigorously evaluate our method using a large, multi-center dataset of micro-ultrasound data.

| **[PathFinder: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent System for Medical Diagnostic Decision-Making Applied to Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08916v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing diseases through histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is fundamental in modern pathology but is challenged by the gigapixel scale and complexity of WSIs. Trained histopathologists overcome this challenge by navigating the WSI, looking for relevant patches, taking notes, and compiling them to produce a final holistic diagnostic. Traditional AI approaches, such as multiple instance learning and transformer-based models, fail short of such a holistic, iterative, multi-scale diagnostic procedure, limiting their adoption in the real-world. We introduce PathFinder, a multi-modal, multi-agent framework that emulates the decision-making process of expert pathologists. PathFinder integrates four AI agents, the Triage Agent, Navigation Agent, Description Agent, and Diagnosis Agent, that collaboratively navigate WSIs, gather evidence, and provide comprehensive diagnoses with natural language explanations. The Triage Agent classifies the WSI as benign or risky; if risky, the Navigation and Description Agents iteratively focus on significant regions, generating importance maps and descriptive insights of sampled patches. Finally, the Diagnosis Agent synthesizes the findings to determine the patient's diagnostic classification. Our Experiments show that PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods in skin melanoma diagnosis by 8% while offering inherent explainability through natural language descriptions of diagnostically relevant patches. Qualitative analysis by pathologists shows that the Description Agent's outputs are of high quality and comparable to GPT-4o. PathFinder is also the first AI-based system to surpass the average performance of pathologists in this challenging melanoma classification task by 9%, setting a new record for efficient, accurate, and interpretable AI-assisted diagnostics in pathology.

Although rumor detection and stance detection are distinct tasks, they can complement each other. Rumors can be identified by cross-referencing stances in related posts, and stances are influenced by the nature of the rumor. However, existing stance detection methods often require post-level stance annotations, which are costly to obtain. We propose a novel LLM-enhanced MIL approach to jointly predict post stance and claim class labels, supervised solely by claim labels, using an undirected microblog propagation model. Our weakly supervised approach relies only on bag-level labels of claim veracity, aligning with multi-instance learning (MIL) principles. To achieve this, we transform the multi-class problem into multiple MIL-based binary classification problems. We then employ a discriminative attention layer to aggregate the outputs from these classifiers into finer-grained classes. Experiments conducted on three rumor datasets and two stance datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting strong connections between rumor veracity and expressed stances in responding posts. Our method shows promising performance in joint rumor and stance detection compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ACM TIST |

However, these methods heavily depend on a substantial number of bag-level labels and solely learn from the original slides, which are easily affected by variations in data distribution. Recently, vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However, the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge, therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance. Moreover, the collection of such pairs and the pre-training process are very time-consuming and source-intensive.To solve the above problems, we propose a dual-scale vision-language multiple instance learning (ViLa-MIL) framework for whole slide image classification. Specifically, we propose a dual-scale visual descriptive text prompt based on the frozen large language model (LLM) to boost the performance of VLM effectively. To transfer the VLM to process WSI efficiently, for the image branch, we propose a prototype-guided patch decoder to aggregate the patch features progressively by grouping similar patches into the same prototype; for the text branch, we introduce a context-guided text decoder to enhance the text features by incorporating the multi-granular image contexts. Extensive studies on three multi-cancer and multi-center subtyping datasets demonstrate the superiority of ViLa-MIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (Updated version with corrections for typos and errors.)</p></details> |
| **[Milmer: a Framework for Multiple Instance Learning based Multimodal Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00547v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emotions play a crucial role in human behavior and decision-making, making emotion recognition a key area of interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). This study addresses the challenges of emotion recognition by integrating facial expression analysis with electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, introducing a novel multimodal framework-Milmer. The proposed framework employs a transformer-based fusion approach to effectively integrate visual and physiological modalities. It consists of an EEG preprocessing module, a facial feature extraction and balancing module, and a cross-modal fusion module. To enhance visual feature extraction, we fine-tune a pre-trained Swin Transformer on emotion-related datasets. Additionally, a cross-attention mechanism is introduced to balance token representation across modalities, ensuring effective feature integration. A key innovation of this work is the adoption of a multiple instance learning (MIL) approach, which extracts meaningful information from multiple facial expression images over time, capturing critical temporal dynamics often overlooked in previous studies. Extensive experiments conducted on the DEAP dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.72% in the four-class emotion recognition task. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of each module, highlighting the significance of advanced feature extraction and fusion strategies in enhancing emotion recognition performance.

| **[The Role of Graph-based MIL and Interventional Training in the Generalization of WSI Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19048v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Imaging (WSI), which involves high-resolution digital scans of pathology slides, has become the gold standard for cancer diagnosis, but its gigapixel resolution and the scarcity of annotated datasets present challenges for deep learning models. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), a widely-used weakly supervised approach, bypasses the need for patch-level annotations. However, conventional MIL methods overlook the spatial relationships between patches, which are crucial for tasks such as cancer grading and diagnosis. To address this, graph-based approaches have gained prominence by incorporating spatial information through node connections. Despite their potential, both MIL and graph-based models are vulnerable to learning spurious associations, like color variations in WSIs, affecting their robustness. In this dissertation, we conduct an extensive comparison of multiple graph construction techniques, MIL models, graph-MIL approaches, and interventional training, introducing a new framework, Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning with Interventional Training (GMIL-IT), for WSI classification. We evaluate their impact on model generalization through domain shift analysis and demonstrate that graph-based models alone achieve the generalization initially anticipated from interventional training.

| **[Dynamic Hypergraph Representation for Bone Metastasis Cancer Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16787v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bone metastasis analysis is a significant challenge in pathology and plays a critical role in determining patient quality of life and treatment strategies. The microenvironment and specific tissue structures are essential for pathologists to predict the primary bone cancer origins and primary bone cancer subtyping. By digitizing bone tissue sections into whole slide images (WSIs) and leveraging deep learning to model slide embeddings, this analysis can be enhanced. However, tumor metastasis involves complex multivariate interactions with diverse bone tissue structures, which traditional WSI analysis methods such as multiple instance learning (MIL) fail to capture. Moreover, graph neural networks (GNNs), limited to modeling pairwise relationships, are hard to represent high-order biological associations. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic hypergraph neural network (DyHG) that overcomes the edge construction limitations of traditional graph representations by connecting multiple nodes via hyperedges. A low-rank strategy is used to reduce the complexity of parameters in learning hypergraph structures, while a Gumbel-Softmax-based sampling strategy optimizes the patch distribution across hyperedges. An MIL aggregator is then used to derive a graph-level embedding for comprehensive WSI analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of DyHG, we construct two large-scale datasets for primary bone cancer origins and subtyping classification based on real-world bone metastasis scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyHG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, showcasing its ability to model complex biological interactions and improve the accuracy of bone metastasis analysis.</p></details> | 12 pages,11 figures |

In this study, we propose MEDFORM, a multimodal pre-training strategy that guides CT image representation learning using complementary information from clinical data for medical foundation model development. MEDFORM efficiently processes CT slice through multiple instance learning (MIL) and adopts a dual pre-training strategy: first pretraining the CT slice feature extractor using SimCLR-based self-supervised learning, then aligning CT and clinical modalities through cross-modal contrastive learning. Our model was pre-trained on three different cancer types: lung cancer (141,171 slices), breast cancer (8,100 slices), colorectal cancer (10,393 slices). The experimental results demonstrated that this dual pre-training strategy improves cancer classification performance and maintains robust performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

| **[TeD-Loc: Text Distillation for Weakly Supervised Object Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12632v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) using classification models trained with only image-class labels remains an important challenge in computer vision. Given their reliance on classification objectives, traditional WSOL methods like class activation mapping focus on the most discriminative object parts, often missing the full spatial extent. In contrast, recent WSOL methods based on vision-language models like CLIP require ground truth classes or external classifiers to produce a localization map, limiting their deployment in downstream tasks. Moreover, methods like GenPromp attempt to address these issues but introduce considerable complexity due to their reliance on conditional denoising processes and intricate prompt learning. This paper introduces Text Distillation for Localization (TeD-Loc), an approach that directly distills knowledge from CLIP text embeddings into the model backbone and produces patch-level localization. Multiple instance learning of these image patches allows for accurate localization and classification using one model without requiring external classifiers. Such integration of textual and visual modalities addresses the longstanding challenge of achieving accurate localization and classification concurrently, as WSOL methods in the literature typically converge at different epochs. Extensive experiments show that leveraging text embeddings and localization cues provides a cost-effective WSOL model. TeD-Loc improves Top-1 LOC accuracy over state-of-the-art models by about 5% on both CUB and ILSVRC datasets, while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to GenPromp.</p></details> |  |

Artificial intelligence-based systems for automated analysis of histopathological images are promising to contribute to an accurate diagnosis of ES. In this context, this study explores the feature extraction ability of different pre-training strategies for distinguishing ES from other soft tissue or bone sarcomas with similar morphology in digitized tissue microarrays for the first time, as far as we know. Vision-language supervision (VLS) is compared to fully-supervised ImageNet pre-training within a multiple instance learning paradigm. Our findings indicate a substantial improvement in diagnostic accuracy with the adaption of VLS using an in-domain dataset. Notably, these models not only enhance the accuracy of predicted classes but also drastically reduce the number of trainable parameters and computational costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

In histopathology, MIL models have achieved remarkable success in tasks like tumor detection, biomarker prediction, and outcome prognostication. However, MIL explanation methods are still lagging behind, as they are limited to small bag sizes or disregard instance interactions. We revisit MIL through the lens of explainable AI (XAI) and introduce xMIL, a refined framework with more general assumptions. We demonstrate how to obtain improved MIL explanations using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and conduct extensive evaluation experiments on three toy settings and four real-world histopathology datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms previous explanation attempts with particularly improved faithfulness scores on challenging biomarker prediction tasks. Finally, we showcase how xMIL explanations enable pathologists to extract insights from MIL models, representing a significant advance for knowledge discovery and model debugging in digital histopathology.

| **[Label-free Concept Based Multiple Instance Learning for Gigapixel Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02922v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods allow for gigapixel Whole-Slide Image (WSI) analysis with only slide-level annotations. Interpretability is crucial for safely deploying such algorithms in high-stakes medical domains. Traditional MIL methods offer explanations by highlighting salient regions. However, such spatial heatmaps provide limited insights for end users. To address this, we propose a novel inherently interpretable WSI-classification approach that uses human-understandable pathology concepts to generate explanations. Our proposed Concept MIL model leverages recent advances in vision-language models to directly predict pathology concepts based on image features. The model's predictions are obtained through a linear combination of the concepts identified on the top-K patches of a WSI, enabling inherent explanations by tracing each concept's influence on the prediction. In contrast to traditional concept-based interpretable models, our approach eliminates the need for costly human annotations by leveraging the vision-language model. We validate our method on two widely used pathology datasets: Camelyon16 and PANDA. On both datasets, Concept MIL achieves AUC and accuracy scores over 0.9, putting it on par with state-of-the-art models. We further find that 87.1\% (Camelyon16) and 85.3\% (PANDA) of the top 20 patches fall within the tumor region. A user study shows that the concepts identified by our model align with the concepts used by pathologists, making it a promising strategy for human-interpretable WSI classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning with Vision-Language Models for Incremental Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10573v3)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, e.g., tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first Vision-Language-based framework with Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches: one is for generating bag-level features by prototype-guided aggregation of instance features, while the other is for enhancing class features through a combination of class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four public WSI datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

| **[Promptable Representation Distribution Learning and Data Augmentation for Gigapixel Histopathology WSI Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14473v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gigapixel image analysis, particularly for whole slide images (WSIs), often relies on multiple instance learning (MIL). Under the paradigm of MIL, patch image representations are extracted and then fixed during the training of the MIL classifiers for efficiency consideration. However, the invariance of representations makes it difficult to perform data augmentation for WSI-level model training, which significantly limits the performance of the downstream WSI analysis. The current data augmentation methods for gigapixel images either introduce additional computational costs or result in a loss of semantic information, which is hard to meet the requirements for efficiency and stability needed for WSI model training. In this paper, we propose a Promptable Representation Distribution Learning framework (PRDL) for both patch-level representation learning and WSI-level data augmentation. Meanwhile, we explore the use of prompts to guide data augmentation in feature space, which achieves promptable data augmentation for training robust WSI-level models. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method stably outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[MonoBox: Tightness-free Box-supervised Polyp Segmentation using Monotonicity Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01188v5)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose MonoBox, an innovative box-supervised segmentation method constrained by monotonicity to liberate its training from the user-unfriendly box-tightness assumption. In contrast to conventional box-supervised segmentation, where the box edges must precisely touch the target boundaries, MonoBox leverages imprecisely-annotated boxes to achieve robust pixel-wise segmentation. The 'linchpin' is that, within the noisy zones around box edges, MonoBox discards the traditional misguiding multiple-instance learning loss, and instead optimizes a carefully-designed objective, termed monotonicity constraint. Along directions transitioning from the foreground to background, this new constraint steers responses to adhere to a trend of monotonically decreasing values. Consequently, the originally unreliable learning within the noisy zones is transformed into a correct and effective monotonicity optimization. Moreover, an adaptive label correction is introduced, enabling MonoBox to enhance the tightness of box annotations using predicted masks from the previous epoch and dynamically shrink the noisy zones as training progresses. We verify MonoBox in the box-supervised segmentation task of polyps, where satisfying box-tightness is challenging due to the vague boundaries between the polyp and normal tissues. Experiments on both public synthetic and in-house real noisy datasets demonstrate that MonoBox exceeds other anti-noise state-of-the-arts by improving Dice by at least 5.5% and 3.3%, respectively.

While existing approaches typically integrate encoded omic data with histology at either an early or late fusion stage, the potential of reintroducing omic data through dual fusion remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose the use of omic embeddings during early and late fusion to capture complementary information from local (patch-level) to global (slide-level) interactions, boosting performance through multimodal integration. In the early fusion stage, omic embeddings are projected onto WSI patches in latent-space, which generates embeddings that encapsulate per-patch molecular and morphological insights. This effectively incorporates omic information into the spatial representation of the WSI. These embeddings are then refined with a Multiple Instance Learning gated attention mechanism which attends to diagnostic patches. In the late fusion stage, we reintroduce the omic data by fusing it with slide-level omic-WSI embeddings using a Multimodal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB), which richly intermingles features from both modalities, capturing their correlations and complementarity. We demonstrate accurate CNS tumor subtyping across 20 fine-grained subtypes and validate our approach on benchmark datasets, achieving improved survival prediction on TCGA-BLCA and competitive performance on TCGA-BRCA compared to state-of-the-art methods. This dual fusion strategy enhances interpretability and classification performance, highlighting its potential for clinical diagnostics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised to 10 pages, with corrected typos, updated references (some added, others removed), improved figure quality, modified text for better method validation, added one more co-author, and identified the IEEE member</p></details> |
| **[Tiny Object Detection with Single Point Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05837v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tiny objects, with their limited spatial resolution, often resemble point-like distributions. As a result, bounding box prediction using point-level supervision emerges as a natural and cost-effective alternative to traditional box-level supervision. However, the small scale and lack of distinctive features of tiny objects make point annotations prone to noise, posing significant hurdles for model robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose Point Teacher--the first end-to-end point-supervised method for robust tiny object detection in aerial images. To handle label noise from scale ambiguity and location shifts in point annotations, Point Teacher employs the teacher-student architecture and decouples the learning into a two-phase denoising process. In this framework, the teacher network progressively denoises the pseudo boxes derived from noisy point annotations, guiding the student network's learning. Specifically, in the first phase, random masking of image regions facilitates regression learning, enabling the teacher to transform noisy point annotations into coarse pseudo boxes. In the second phase, these coarse pseudo boxes are refined using dynamic multiple instance learning, which adaptively selects the most reliable instance from dynamically constructed proposal bags around the coarse pseudo boxes. Extensive experiments on three tiny object datasets (i.e., AI-TOD-v2, SODA-A, and TinyPerson) validate the proposed method's effectiveness and robustness against point location shifts. Notably, relying solely on point supervision, our Point Teacher already shows comparable performance with box-supervised learning methods. Codes and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Since differentiation of cancer sub-types is important for treatment and current, manual methods are time consuming and subjective, automatic computer-aided differentiation of cancer types is crucial. Manual differentiation of thyroid cancer is based on tissue sections, analysed by pathologists using histological features. Due to the enormous size of gigapixel whole slide images, holistic classification using deep learning methods is not feasible. Patch based multiple instance learning approaches, combined with aggregations such as bag-of-words, is a common approach. This work's contribution is to extend a patch based state-of-the-art method by generating and combining feature vectors of three different patch resolutions and analysing three distinct ways of combining them. The results showed improvements in one of the three multi-scale approaches, while the others led to decreased scores.

However, previous studies only learn from training data, posing a stark contrast to how human clinicians teach each other and reason about histopathologic entities and factors. Here we present a novel knowledge concept-based MIL framework, named ConcepPath to fill this gap. Specifically, ConcepPath utilizes GPT-4 to induce reliable diseasespecific human expert concepts from medical literature, and incorporate them with a group of purely learnable concepts to extract complementary knowledge from training data. In ConcepPath, WSIs are aligned to these linguistic knowledge concepts by utilizing pathology vision-language model as the basic building component. In the application of lung cancer subtyping, breast cancer HER2 scoring, and gastric cancer immunotherapy-sensitive subtyping task, ConcepPath significantly outperformed previous SOTA methods which lack the guidance of human expert knowledge.</p></details> |  |

However, previous UC classification methods (i.e., image-level estimation) mainly assumed the input was a single image. Thus, these methods can not utilize severity labels recorded in real clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a patient-level severity estimation method by a transformer with selective aggregator tokens, where a severity label is estimated from multiple images taken from a patient, similar to a clinical setting. Our method can effectively aggregate features of severe parts from a set of images captured in each patient, and it facilitates improving the discriminative ability between adjacent severity classes. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two datasets compared with the state-of-the-art MIL methods. Moreover, we evaluated our method in real clinical settings and confirmed that our method outperformed the previous image-level methods.

| **[NACNet: A Histology Context-aware Transformer Graph Convolution Network for Predicting Treatment Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09766v2)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics (Nov 07 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Partial Scene Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10261v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of partial scene text retrieval involves localizing and searching for text instances that are the same or similar to a given query text from an image gallery. However, existing methods can only handle text-line instances, leaving the problem of searching for partial patches within these text-line instances unsolved due to a lack of patch annotations in the training data. To address this issue, we propose a network that can simultaneously retrieve both text-line instances and their partial patches. Our method embeds the two types of data (query text and scene text instances) into a shared feature space and measures their cross-modal similarities. To handle partial patches, our proposed approach adopts a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach to learn their similarities with query text, without requiring extra annotations. However, constructing bags, which is a standard step of conventional MIL approaches, can introduce numerous noisy samples for training, and lower inference speed. To address this issue, we propose a Ranking MIL (RankMIL) approach to adaptively filter those noisy samples. Additionally, we present a Dynamic Partial Match Algorithm (DPMA) that can directly search for the target partial patch from a text-line instance during the inference stage, without requiring bags. This greatly improves the search efficiency and the performance of retrieving partial patches.

This development enables comprehensive digital reviews by pathologists and accelerates AI-driven diagnostic support for WSI analysis. Recent advances in foundational pathology models have increased the need for benchmarking tasks. The Camelyon series is one of the most widely used open-source datasets in computational pathology. However, the quality, accessibility, and clinical relevance of the labels have not been comprehensively evaluated. In this study, we reprocessed 1,399 WSIs and labels from the Camelyon-16 and Camelyon-17 datasets, removing low-quality slides, correcting erroneous labels, and providing expert pixel annotations for tumor regions in the previously unreleased test set. Based on the sizes of re-annotated tumor regions, we upgraded the binary cancer screening task to a four-class task: negative, micro-metastasis, macro-metastasis, and Isolated Tumor Cells (ITC). We reevaluated pre-trained pathology feature extractors and multiple instance learning (MIL) methods using the cleaned dataset, providing a benchmark that advances AI development in histopathology.</p></details> |  |

While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

Here, we present an MIL strategy, the Fluoroformer module, that is specifically tailored to multiplexed WSIs by leveraging scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) to interpretably fuse information across disparate channels. On a cohort of 434 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples, we show that the Fluoroformer both obtains strong prognostic performance and recapitulates immuno-oncological hallmarks of NSCLC. Our technique thereby provides a path for adapting state-of-the-art AI techniques to emerging spatial biology assays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings paper presented at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) symposium 2024, December 15-16, 2024, Vancouver, Canada, 14 pages</p></details> |

This paper presents a significant advancement in the field of anomaly detection through the application of Two-Stream Inflated 3D (I3D) Convolutional Networks. These networks substantially outperform traditional 3D Convolutional Networks (C3D) by more effectively extracting spatial and temporal features from surveillance videos, thus improving the precision of anomaly detection. Our research advances the field by implementing a weakly supervised learning framework based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uniquely conceptualizes surveillance videos as collections of 'bags' that contain instances (video clips). Each instance is innovatively processed through a ranking mechanism that prioritizes clips based on their potential to display anomalies. This novel strategy not only enhances the accuracy and precision of anomaly detection but also significantly diminishes the dependency on extensive manual annotations. Moreover, through meticulous optimization of model settings, including the choice of optimizer, our approach not only establishes new benchmarks in the performance of anomaly detection systems but also offers a scalable and efficient solution for real-world surveillance applications. This paper contributes significantly to the field of computer vision by delivering a more adaptable, efficient, and context-aware anomaly detection system, which is poised to redefine practices in urban surveillance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |
| **[CIMIL-CRC: a clinically-informed multiple instance learning framework for patient-level colorectal cancer molecular subtypes classification from H\&E stained images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16131v2)** | 2024-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Treatment approaches for colorectal cancer (CRC) are highly dependent on the molecular subtype, as immunotherapy has shown efficacy in cases with microsatellite instability (MSI) but is ineffective for the microsatellite stable (MSS) subtype. There is promising potential in utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate the differentiation of CRC subtypes by analyzing Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). Due to the extensive size of WSIs, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques are typically explored. However, existing MIL methods focus on identifying the most representative image patches for classification, which may result in the loss of critical information. Additionally, these methods often overlook clinically relevant information, like the tendency for MSI class tumors to predominantly occur on the proximal (right side) colon. We introduce `CIMIL-CRC', a DNN framework that: 1) solves the MSI/MSS MIL problem by efficiently combining a pre-trained feature extraction model with principal component analysis (PCA) to aggregate information from all patches, and 2) integrates clinical priors, particularly the tumor location within the colon, into the model to enhance patient-level classification accuracy. We assessed our CIMIL-CRC method using the average area under the curve (AUC) from a 5-fold cross-validation experimental setup for model development on the TCGA-CRC-DX cohort, contrasting it with a baseline patch-level classification, MIL-only approach, and Clinically-informed patch-level classification approach. Our CIMIL-CRC outperformed all methods (AUROC: $0.92\pm0.002$ (95\% CI 0.91-0.92), vs. $0.79\pm0.02$ (95\% CI 0.76-0.82), $0.86\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.85-0.88), and $0.87\pm0.01$ (95\% CI 0.86-0.88), respectively).

| **[Weak to Strong Learning from Aggregate Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06200v1)** | 2024-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In learning from aggregate labels, the training data consists of sets or "bags" of feature-vectors (instances) along with an aggregate label for each bag derived from the (usually {0,1}-valued) labels of its instances. In learning from label proportions (LLP), the aggregate label is the average of the bag's instance labels, whereas in multiple instance learning (MIL) it is the OR. The goal is to train an instance-level predictor, typically achieved by fitting a model on the training data, in particular one that maximizes the accuracy which is the fraction of satisfied bags i.e., those on which the predicted labels are consistent with the aggregate label. A weak learner has at a constant accuracy < 1 on the training bags, while a strong learner's accuracy can be arbitrarily close to 1. We study the problem of using a weak learner on such training bags with aggregate labels to obtain a strong learner, analogous to supervised learning for which boosting algorithms are known. Our first result shows the impossibility of boosting in LLP using weak classifiers of any accuracy < 1 by constructing a collection of bags for which such weak learners (for any weight assignment) exist, while not admitting any strong learner. A variant of this construction also rules out boosting in MIL for a non-trivial range of weak learner accuracy. In the LLP setting however, we show that a weak learner (with small accuracy) on large enough bags can in fact be used to obtain a strong learner for small bags, in polynomial time. We also provide more efficient, sampling based variant of our procedure with probabilistic guarantees which are empirically validated on three real and two synthetic datasets. Our work is the first to theoretically study weak to strong learning from aggregate labels, with an algorithm to achieve the same for LLP, while proving the impossibility of boosting for both LLP and MIL.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</p></details> |  |

Inflammatory processes in the placenta have short-term, and long-term consequences for offspring health. Digital pathology and machine learning can play an important role in understanding placental inflammation, and there have been very few investigations into methods for predicting and understanding Maternal Inflammatory Response (MIR). This work intends to investigate the potential of using machine learning to understand MIR based on whole slide images (WSI), and establish early benchmarks. To that end, we use Multiple Instance Learning framework with 3 feature extractors: ImageNet-based EfficientNet-v2s, and 2 histopathology foundation models, UNI and Phikon to investigate predictability of MIR stage from histopathology WSIs. We also interpret predictions from these models using the learned attention maps from these models. We also use the MIL framework for predicting white blood cells count (WBC) and maximum fever temperature ($T_{max}$). Attention-based MIL models are able to classify MIR with a balanced accuracy of up to 88.5% with a Cohen's Kappa ($κ$) of up to 0.772. Furthermore, we found that the pathology foundation models (UNI and Phikon) are both able to achieve higher performance with balanced accuracy and $κ$, compared to ImageNet-based feature extractor (EfficientNet-v2s). For WBC and $T_{max}$ prediction, we found mild correlation between actual values and those predicted from histopathology WSIs. We used MIL framework for predicting MIR stage from WSIs, and compared effectiveness of foundation models as feature extractors, with that of an ImageNet-based model. We further investigated model failure cases and found them to be either edge cases prone to interobserver variability, examples of pathologist's overreach, or mislabeled due to processing errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[MamMIL: Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Images with State Space Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05160v3)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, pathological diagnosis has achieved superior performance by combining deep learning models with the multiple instance learning (MIL) framework using whole slide images (WSIs). However, the giga-pixeled nature of WSIs poses a great challenge for efficient MIL. Existing studies either do not consider global dependencies among instances, or use approximations such as linear attentions to model the pair-to-pair instance interactions, which inevitably brings performance bottlenecks. To tackle this challenge, we propose a framework named MamMIL for WSI analysis by cooperating the selective structured state space model (i.e., Mamba) with MIL, enabling the modeling of global instance dependencies while maintaining linear complexity. Specifically, considering the irregularity of the tissue regions in WSIs, we represent each WSI as an undirected graph. To address the problem that Mamba can only process 1D sequences, we further propose a topology-aware scanning mechanism to serialize the WSI graphs while preserving the topological relationships among the instances. Finally, in order to further perceive the topological structures among the instances and incorporate short-range feature interactions, we propose an instance aggregation block based on graph neural networks. Experiments show that MamMIL can achieve advanced performance than the state-of-the-art frameworks. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/Vison307/MamMIL.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.

We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks.

Previous methods cannot effectively capture the intricate interaction features among instances within the local area of WSI. Moreover, existing methods for cancer survival prediction based on WSI often fail to provide better clinically meaningful predictions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Sparse Context-aware Multiple Instance Learning (SCMIL) framework for predicting cancer survival probability distributions. SCMIL innovatively segments patches into various clusters based on their morphological features and spatial location information, subsequently leveraging sparse self-attention to discern the relationships between these patches with a context-aware perspective. Considering many patches are irrelevant to the task, we introduce a learnable patch filtering module called SoftFilter, which ensures that only interactions between task-relevant patches are considered. To enhance the clinical relevance of our prediction, we propose a register-based mixture density network to forecast the survival probability distribution for individual patients. We evaluate SCMIL on two public WSI datasets from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) specifically focusing on lung adenocarcinom (LUAD) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). Our experimental results indicate that SCMIL outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for survival prediction, offering more clinically meaningful and interpretable outcomes.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework.

| **[Slide-based Graph Collaborative Training for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10260v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of computational pathology lies in the consensus that pathological characteristics of tumors are significant guidance for cancer diagnostics. Most existing research focuses on the inner-contextual information within each WSI yet ignores the possible inter-correlations between slides. As the development of tumors is a continuous process involving a series of histological, morphological, and genetic changes that accumulate over time, the similarities and differences between WSIs across various stages, grades, locations and patients should potentially contribute to the representation of WSIs and deserve to be taken into account in WSI modeling. To verify the advancement of introducing the slide inter-correlations into the representation learning of WSIs, we proposed a generic WSI analysis pipeline SlideGCD that can be adapted to any existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) frameworks and improve their performance. With the new paradigm, the prior knowledge of cancer development can participate in the end-to-end workflow, which concurrently initializes and refines the slide representation, as a guide for message passing in the slide-based graph. Extensive comparisons and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed pipeline across 4 different tasks, including cancer subtyping, cancer staging, survival prediction, and gene mutation prediction, with 7 representative SOTA WSI analysis frameworks as backbones.</p></details> |  |

However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5\%, 95.9\%, and 88.1\%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

However, current methods fall short in bridging the domain gap between pretrained models and medical imaging, and often fail to account for spatial relationships across different magnifications. Addressing these challenges, we introduce the Concentric Dual Fusion Attention-MIL (CDFA-MIL) framework,which innovatively combines point-to-area feature-colum attention and point-to-point concentric-row attention using concentric patch. This approach is designed to effectively fuse correlated information, enhancing feature representation and providing stronger correlation guidance for WSI analysis. CDFA-MIL distinguishes itself by offering a robust fusion strategy that leads to superior WSI recognition. Its application has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly surpassing existing MIL methods in accuracy and F1 scores on prominent datasets like Camelyon16 and TCGA-NSCLC. Specifically, CDFA-MIL achieved an average accuracy and F1-score of 93.7\% and 94.1\% respectively on these datasets, marking a notable advancement over traditional MIL approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Need ...</summary><p>Need for additional experiments</p></details> |

A WSI, acquired at gigapixel size, is commonly tiled into patches and processed by multiple-instance learning (MIL) models. Previous MIL-based models designed for this problem have only been evaluated on individual tasks for specific organs, and the ability to handle multiple tasks within a single model has not been investigated. In this study, we propose MECFormer, a generative Transformer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks within one model. To leverage the power of learning multiple tasks simultaneously and to enhance the model's effectiveness in focusing on each individual task, we introduce an Expert Consultation Network, a projection layer placed at the beginning of the Transformer-based model. Additionally, to enable flexible classification, autoregressive decoding is incorporated by a language decoder for WSI classification.

Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pages...</summary><p>Pages 4, Figures 1, Table 1</p></details> |

Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Cancer Modeling in the Age of Foundation Model Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07683v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has enabled novel discoveries and served as a large-scale reference dataset in cancer through its harmonized genomics, clinical, and imaging data. Numerous prior studies have developed bespoke deep learning models over TCGA for tasks such as cancer survival prediction. A modern paradigm in biomedical deep learning is the development of foundation models (FMs) to derive feature embeddings agnostic to a specific modeling task. Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the ability to train classical machine learning models over multimodal, zero-shot FM embeddings of cancer data. We demonstrate the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models. Further, we show the benefit of including pathology report text and rigorously evaluate the effect of model-based text summarization and hallucination. Overall, we propose an embedding-centric approach to multimodal cancer modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>camer...</summary><p>camera ready version for ML4H 2025</p></details> |

Existing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) strategies often depend on large annotated datasets, limiting their scalability and adaptability. In this study, we introduce two Knowledge Elicitation methods designed to overcome these limitations by enabling large language models (LLMs) to induce and apply domain-specific rules for cancer staging. The first, Knowledge Elicitation with Long-Term Memory (KEwLTM), uses an iterative prompting strategy to derive staging rules directly from unannotated pathology reports, without requiring ground-truth labels. The second, Knowledge Elicitation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KEwRAG), employs a variation of RAG where rules are pre-extracted from relevant guidelines in a single step and then applied, enhancing interpretability and avoiding repeated retrieval overhead. We leverage the ability of LLMs to apply broad knowledge learned during pre-training to new tasks. Using breast cancer pathology reports from the TCGA dataset, we evaluate their performance in identifying T and N stages, comparing them against various baseline approaches on two open-source LLMs. Our results indicate that KEwLTM outperforms KEwRAG when Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought (ZSCOT) inference is effective, whereas KEwRAG achieves better performance when ZSCOT inference is less effective. Both methods offer transparent, interpretable interfaces by making the induced rules explicit. These findings highlight the promise of our Knowledge Elicitation methods as scalable, high-performing solutions for automated cancer staging with enhanced interpretability, particularly in clinical settings with limited annotated data.</p></details> |  |

Current vision-language (VL) models often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.</p></details> | Accept by EMNLP2025 |

Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows, offer readily available complementary information by summarizing histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities). Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports, leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Guiding Language Model Choice for Specialized Applications in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21191v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to guide language model selection by investigating: 1) the necessity of finetuning versus zero-shot usage, 2) the benefits of domain-adjacent versus generic pretrained models, 3) the value of further domain-specific pretraining, and 4) the continued relevance of Small Language Models (SLMs) compared to Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks. Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data. While LLMs offer strong zero-shot capabilities, their performance on these specific tasks did not match that of appropriately finetuned SLMs. In the era of LLMs, SLMs remain relevant and effective, offering a potentially superior performance-resource trade-off compared to LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing WSI-Based Survival Analysis with Report-Auxiliary Self-Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15608v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods.

Methods: Glo-UMF decouples quantification tasks by constructing three dedicated deep models: an ultrastructure segmentation model, a glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) region classification model, and an electron-dense deposits (EDD) detection model. Their outputs are integrated through a post-processing workflow with adaptive GFB cropping and measurement location screening, enhancing measurement reliability and providing comprehensive quantitative results that overcome the limitations of traditional grading. Results: Trained on 372 electron microscopy images, Glo-UMF enables simultaneous quantification of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) thickness, the degree of foot process effacement (FPE), and EDD location. In 115 test cases spanning 9 renal pathological types, the automated quantification results showed strong agreement with pathological reports, with an average processing time of 4.23$\pm$0.48 seconds per case on a CPU environment. Conclusions: The modular design of Glo-UMF allows for flexible extensibility, supporting the joint quantification of multiple features. This framework ensures robust generalization and clinical applicability, demonstrating significant potential as an efficient auxiliary tool in glomerular pathological analysis.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |
| **[HoneyBee: A Scalable Modular Framework for Creating Multimodal Oncology Datasets with Foundational Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07460v5)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>HONeYBEE (Harmonized ONcologY Biomedical Embedding Encoder) is an open-source framework that integrates multimodal biomedical data for oncology applications. It processes clinical data (structured and unstructured), whole-slide images, radiology scans, and molecular profiles to generate unified patient-level embeddings using domain-specific foundation models and fusion strategies. These embeddings enable survival prediction, cancer-type classification, patient similarity retrieval, and cohort clustering. Evaluated on 11,400+ patients across 33 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), clinical embeddings showed the strongest single-modality performance with 98.5% classification accuracy and 96.4% precision@10 in patient retrieval. They also achieved the highest survival prediction concordance indices across most cancer types. Multimodal fusion provided complementary benefits for specific cancers, improving overall survival prediction beyond clinical features alone. Comparative evaluation of four large language models revealed that general-purpose models like Qwen3 outperformed specialized medical models for clinical text representation, though task-specific fine-tuning improved performance on heterogeneous data such as pathology reports.</p></details> |  |

In this study we developed a robust system for automated extraction of the specific cancer types for the purpose of supporting precision oncology research. from pathology reports using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model. This model significantly outperformed the baseline model and a Large Language Model, Mistral 7B, achieving F1_Bertscore 0.98 and overall exact match of 80.61%. This fine-tuning approach demonstrates the potential for scalability that can integrate seamlessly into the molecular tumour board process. Fine-tuning domain-specific models for precision tasks in oncology, may pave the way for more efficient and accurate clinical information extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can human clinical rationales improve the performance and explainability of clinical text classification models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21302v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649 electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority, training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale coverage) compared to training on additional reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiagR1: A Vision-Language Model Trained via Reinforcement Learning for Digestive Pathology Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18433v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[VLCD: Vision-Language Contrastive Distillation for Accurate and Efficient Automatic Placenta Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02229v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 9th International Workshop on Health Intelligence, in conjunction with the Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March 2025</p></details> |
| **[Any-to-Any Learning in Computational Pathology via Triplet Multimodal Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12711v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computational pathology and artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the utilization of gigapixel whole-slide images and and additional modalities (e.g., genomics) for pathological diagnosis. Although deep learning has demonstrated strong potential in pathology, several key challenges persist: (1) fusing heterogeneous data types requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple concatenation due to high computational costs; (2) common scenarios of missing modalities necessitate flexible strategies that allow the model to learn robustly in the absence of certain modalities; (3) the downstream tasks in CPath are diverse, ranging from unimodal to multimodal, cnecessitating a unified model capable of handling all modalities. To address these challenges, we propose ALTER, an any-to-any tri-modal pretraining framework that integrates WSIs, genomics, and pathology reports. The term "any" emphasizes ALTER's modality-adaptive design, enabling flexible pretraining with any subset of modalities, and its capacity to learn robust, cross-modal representations beyond WSI-centric approaches. We evaluate ALTER across extensive clinical tasks including survival prediction, cancer subtyping, gene mutation prediction, and report generation, achieving superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Global explainability of a deep abstaining classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01202v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a global explainability method to characterize sources of errors in the histology prediction task of our real-world multitask convolutional neural network (MTCNN)-based deep abstaining classifier (DAC), for automated annotation of cancer pathology reports from NCI-SEER registries. Our classifier was trained and evaluated on 1.04 million hand-annotated samples and makes simultaneous predictions of cancer site, subsite, histology, laterality, and behavior for each report. The DAC framework enables the model to abstain on ambiguous reports and/or confusing classes to achieve a target accuracy on the retained (non-abstained) samples, but at the cost of decreased coverage. Requiring 97% accuracy on the histology task caused our model to retain only 22% of all samples, mostly the less ambiguous and common classes. Local explainability with the GradInp technique provided a computationally efficient way of obtaining contextual reasoning for thousands of individual predictions. Our method, involving dimensionality reduction of approximately 13000 aggregated local explanations, enabled global identification of sources of errors as hierarchical complexity among classes, label noise, insufficient information, and conflicting evidence. This suggests several strategies such as exclusion criteria, focused annotation, and reduced penalties for errors involving hierarchically related classes to iteratively improve our DAC in this complex real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, these LLMs typically have several billions of parameters, making them computationally expensive for healthcare systems. Thus, in this study, we propose CancerLLM, a model with 7 billion parameters and a Mistral-style architecture, pre-trained on nearly 2.7M clinical notes and over 515K pathology reports covering 17 cancer types, followed by fine-tuning on two cancer-relevant tasks, including cancer phenotypes extraction and cancer diagnosis generation. Our evaluation demonstrated that the CancerLLM achieves state-of-the-art results with F1 score of 91.78% on phenotyping extraction and 86.81% on disganois generation. It outperformed existing LLMs, with an average F1 score improvement of 9.23%.

Method: We analyzed 2,258 colonoscopy images with corresponding pathology reports from 428 patients. We preprocessed all images using standardized techniques (resizing, normalization, and augmentation) and implemented a rigorous comparative framework evaluating 11 distinct models: ResNet50, 4 CMLs (random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, decision tree), two specialized contrastive vision language encoders (CLIP, BiomedCLIP), and three general-purpose VLMs ( GPT-4 Gemini-1.5-Pro, Claude-3-Opus). Our performance assessment focused on two clinical tasks: polyp detection (CADe) and classification (CADx). Result: In polyp detection, ResNet50 achieved the best performance (F1: 91.35%, AUROC: 0.98), followed by BiomedCLIP (F1: 88.68%, AUROC: [AS1] ). GPT-4 demonstrated comparable effectiveness to traditional machine learning approaches (F1: 81.02%, AUROC: [AS2] ), outperforming other general-purpose VLMs. For polyp classification, performance rankings remained consistent but with lower overall metrics. ResNet50 maintained the highest efficacy (weighted F1: 74.94%), while GPT-4 demonstrated moderate capability (weighted F1: 41.18%), significantly exceeding other VLMs (Claude-3-Opus weighted F1: 25.54%, Gemini 1.5 Pro weighted F1: 6.17%). Conclusion: CNNs remain superior for both CADx and CADe tasks. However, VLMs like BioMedCLIP and GPT-4 may be useful for polyp detection tasks where training CNNs is not feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/aminkhalafi/CML-vs-LLM-on-Polyp-Detection.

| **[A Multimodal Knowledge-enhanced Whole-slide Pathology Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15362v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remarkable strides in computational pathology have been made in the task-agnostic foundation model that advances the performance of a wide array of downstream clinical tasks. Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages |
| **[ELM: Ensemble of Language Models for Predicting Tumor Group from Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21800v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) face a significant bottleneck in manually extracting data from unstructured pathology reports, a process crucial for tasks like tumor group assignment, which can consume 900 person-hours for approximately 100,000 reports. To address this, we introduce ELM (Ensemble of Language Models), a novel ensemble-based approach leveraging both small language models (SLMs) and large language models (LLMs). ELM utilizes six fine-tuned SLMs, where three SLMs use the top part of the pathology report and three SLMs use the bottom part. This is done to maximize report coverage. ELM requires five-out-of-six agreement for a tumor group classification. Disagreements are arbitrated by an LLM with a carefully curated prompt. Our evaluation across nineteen tumor groups demonstrates ELM achieves an average precision and recall of 0.94, outperforming single-model and ensemble-without-LLM approaches. Deployed at the British Columbia Cancer Registry, ELM demonstrates how LLMs can be successfully applied in a PBCR setting to achieve state-of-the-art results and significantly enhance operational efficiencies, saving hundreds of person-hours annually.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Scalable and Cross-Lingual Specialist Language Models for Oncology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08323v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical oncology generates vast, unstructured data that often contain inconsistencies, missing information, and ambiguities, making it difficult to extract reliable insights for data-driven decision-making. General-purpose large language models (LLMs) struggle with these challenges due to their lack of domain-specific reasoning, including specialized clinical terminology, context-dependent interpretations, and multi-modal data integration. We address these issues with an oncology-specialized, efficient, and adaptable NLP framework that combines instruction tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and graph-based knowledge integration. Our lightweight models prove effective at oncology-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition (e.g., identifying cancer diagnoses), entity linking (e.g., linking entities to standardized ontologies), TNM staging, document classification (e.g., cancer subtype classification from pathology reports), and treatment response prediction. Our framework emphasizes adaptability and resource efficiency. We include minimal German instructions, collected at the University Hospital Zurich (USZ), to test whether small amounts of non-English language data can effectively transfer knowledge across languages. This approach mirrors our motivation for lightweight models, which balance strong performance with reduced computational costs, making them suitable for resource-limited healthcare settings. We validated our models on oncology datasets, demonstrating strong results in named entity recognition, relation extraction, and document classification.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in the field of pathology, particularly for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured medical texts such as pathology reports, remains underexplored and not well quantified. In this project, we leverage state-of-the-art language models, including the GPT family, Mistral models, and the open-source Llama models, to evaluate their performance in comprehensively analyzing pathology reports. Specifically, we assess their performance in cancer type identification, AJCC stage determination, and prognosis assessment, encompassing both information extraction and higher-order reasoning tasks. Based on a detailed analysis of their performance metrics in a zero-shot setting, we developed two instruction-tuned models: Path-llama3.1-8B and Path-GPT-4o-mini-FT. These models demonstrated superior performance in zero-shot cancer type identification, staging, and prognosis assessment compared to the other models evaluated.</p></details> |  |

| **[Leveraging large language models for structured information extraction from pathology reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12183v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Structured information extraction from unstructured histopathology reports facilitates data accessibility for clinical research. Manual extraction by experts is time-consuming and expensive, limiting scalability. Large language models (LLMs) offer efficient automated extraction through zero-shot prompting, requiring only natural language instructions without labeled data or training. We evaluate LLMs' accuracy in extracting structured information from breast cancer histopathology reports, compared to manual extraction by a trained human annotator. Methods: We developed the Medical Report Information Extractor, a web application leveraging LLMs for automated extraction. We developed a gold standard extraction dataset to evaluate the human annotator alongside five LLMs including GPT-4o, a leading proprietary model, and the Llama 3 model family, which allows self-hosting for data privacy. Our assessment involved 111 histopathology reports from the Breast Cancer Now (BCN) Generations Study, extracting 51 pathology features specified in the study's data dictionary. Results: Evaluation against the gold standard dataset showed that both Llama 3.1 405B (94.7% accuracy) and GPT-4o (96.1%) achieved extraction accuracy comparable to the human annotator (95.4%; p = 0.146 and p = 0.106, respectively). While Llama 3.1 70B (91.6%) performed below human accuracy (p <0.001), its reduced computational requirements make it a viable option for self-hosting. Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for structured information extraction that can be customized by non-programmers using natural language. Its modular design enables reuse for various extraction tasks, producing standardized, structured data from unstructured text reports to facilitate analytics through improved accessibility and interoperability.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10536v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |

Pathology reports on these specimens convey treatment-relevant information. Beyond these reports, the diagnostic process generates extensive and complex information that is difficult to represent in reports, although it is of significant interest to the other medical specialties involved. 3D tissue reconstruction would allow for better spatial visualization, as well as combinations with other imaging modalities. Existing approaches in this area have proven labor-intensive and challenging to integrate into clinical workflows. 3D-SLIVER provides a simplified solution, implemented as an open-source 3DSlicer extension. We outline three specific real-world scenarios to illustrate its potential to improve transparency in diagnostic workflows and contribute to multi-modal research endeavors. Implementing the 3D reconstruction process involved four sub-modules of 3D-SLIVER: digitization of slicing protocol, virtual slicing of arbitrary 3D models based on that protocol, registration of slides with virtual slices using the Coherent Point Drift algorithm, and 3D reconstruction of registered information using convex hulls, Gaussian splatter and linear extrusion. Three use cases to employ 3D-SLIVER are presented: a low-effort approach to pathology workflow integration and two research-related use cases illustrating how to perform retrospective evaluations of PI-RADS predictions and statistically model 3D distributions of morphological patterns. 3D-SLIVER allows for improved interdisciplinary communication among specialties. It is designed for simplicity in application, allowing for flexible integration into various workflows and use cases. Here we focused on the clinical care of prostate cancer patients, but future possibilities are extensive with other neoplasms and in education and research.</p></details> |  |

However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

Recent approaches generally rely on weakly supervised learning due to the ease of acquiring case-level labels from pathology reports. However, patch-level classification is preferable in applications where only a limited number of cases are available or when local prediction accuracy is critical. On the other hand, acquiring extensive datasets with localized labels for training is not feasible. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised patch-level histopathological image classification model, named CLASS-M, that does not require extensively labeled datasets. CLASS-M is formed by two main parts: a contrastive learning module that uses separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images generated through an adaptive stain separation process, and a module with pseudo-labels using MixUp. We compare our model with other state-of-the-art models on two clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets. We demonstrate that our CLASS-M model has the best performance on both datasets.

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, it has altered the diagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process. The limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath can be overcome by FMs through learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide variety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. Deploying VLMs allow pathology reports written in natural language be used as rich semantic information sources to improve existing models as well as generate predictions in natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of recent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the tools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in addition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey highlights the current trends in CPath and its possible revolution through the use of FMs and VLMs in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 19 figures and 9 tables</p></details> |

Methods and Materials: The study utilized two datasets: 7,294 radiology reports annotated for Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) scores and 2,154 pathology reports annotated for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. An automated pipeline was developed to benchmark the performance of various LMs and RAG configurations. The impact of model size, quantization, prompting strategies, output formatting, and inference parameters was systematically evaluated. Results: The best performing models achieved over 98% accuracy in extracting BT-RADS scores from radiology reports and over 90% for IDH mutation status extraction from pathology reports. The top model being medical fine-tuned llama3. Larger, newer, and domain fine-tuned models consistently outperformed older and smaller models. Model quantization had minimal impact on performance. Few-shot prompting significantly improved accuracy. RAG improved performance for complex pathology reports but not for shorter radiology reports. Conclusions: Open LMs demonstrate significant potential for automated extraction of structured clinical data from unstructured clinical reports with local privacy-preserving application. Careful model selection, prompt engineering, and semi-automated optimization using annotated data are critical for optimal performance. These approaches could be reliable enough for practical use in research workflows, highlighting the potential for human-machine collaboration in healthcare data extraction.</p></details> |  |

The rise of multimodal large models has simplified the process of integrating image analysis with textual descriptions. Despite this advancement, the substantial costs associated with training and deploying these complex multimodal models, together with a scarcity of high-quality training datasets, create a significant divide between cutting-edge technology and its application in the clinical setting. We had meticulously compiled a dataset of approximately 45,000 cases, covering over 6 different tasks, including the classification of organ tissues, generating pathology report descriptions, and addressing pathology-related questions and answers. We have fine-tuned multimodal large models, specifically LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternLM, with this dataset to enhance instruction-based performance. We conducted a qualitative assessment of the capabilities of the base model and the fine-tuned model in performing image captioning and classification tasks on the specific dataset. The evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits proficiency in addressing typical pathological questions. We hope that by making both our models and datasets publicly available, they can be valuable to the medical and research communities.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[PathAlign: A vision-language model for whole slide images in histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19578v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microscopic interpretation of histopathology images underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions. While advances in vision-language modeling raise new opportunities for analysis of such images, the gigapixel-scale size of whole slide images (WSIs) introduces unique challenges. Additionally, pathology reports simultaneously highlight key findings from small regions while also aggregating interpretation across multiple slides, often making it difficult to create robust image-text pairs. As such, pathology reports remain a largely untapped source of supervision in computational pathology, with most efforts relying on region-of-interest annotations or self-supervision at the patch-level. In this work, we develop a vision-language model based on the BLIP-2 framework using WSIs paired with curated text from pathology reports. This enables applications utilizing a shared image-text embedding space, such as text or image retrieval for finding cases of interest, as well as integration of the WSI encoder with a frozen large language model (LLM) for WSI-based generative text capabilities such as report generation or AI-in-the-loop interactions. We utilize a de-identified dataset of over 350,000 WSIs and diagnostic text pairs, spanning a wide range of diagnoses, procedure types, and tissue types. We present pathologist evaluation of text generation and text retrieval using WSI embeddings, as well as results for WSI classification and workflow prioritization (slide-level triaging). Model-generated text for WSIs was rated by pathologists as accurate, without clinically significant error or omission, for 78% of WSIs on average. This work demonstrates exciting potential capabilities for language-aligned WSI embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages and 19 pages of supplemental material; 3 main tables, 3 main figures and 11 supplemental tables, 7 supplemental figures</p></details> |

Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (PathText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues and achieve competitive performance on certain slide-level tasks. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping surpassing previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our collected dataset and related code are available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Use of natural language processing to extract and classify papillary thyroid cancer features from surgical pathology reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00015v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background We aim to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction and classification of thyroid cancer risk factors from pathology reports. Methods We analyzed 1,410 surgical pathology reports from adult papillary thyroid cancer patients at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 2010 to 2019. Structured and non-structured reports were used to create a consensus-based ground truth dictionary and categorized them into modified recurrence risk levels. Non-structured reports were narrative, while structured reports followed standardized formats. We then developed ThyroPath, a rule-based NLP pipeline, to extract and classify thyroid cancer features into risk categories. Training involved 225 reports (150 structured, 75 unstructured), with testing on 170 reports (120 structured, 50 unstructured) for evaluation. The pipeline's performance was assessed using both strict and lenient criteria for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results In extraction tasks, ThyroPath achieved overall strict F-1 scores of 93% for structured reports and 90 for unstructured reports, covering 18 thyroid cancer pathology features. In classification tasks, ThyroPath-extracted information demonstrated an overall accuracy of 93% in categorizing reports based on their corresponding guideline-based risk of recurrence: 76.9% for high-risk, 86.8% for intermediate risk, and 100% for both low and very low-risk cases. However, ThyroPath achieved 100% accuracy across all thyroid cancer risk categories with human-extracted pathology information. Conclusions ThyroPath shows promise in automating the extraction and risk recurrence classification of thyroid pathology reports at large scale. It offers a solution to laborious manual reviews and advancing virtual registries. However, it requires further validation before implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Large Multimodal Model based Standardisation of Pathology Reports with Confidence and their Prognostic Significance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02040v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology reports are rich in clinical and pathological details but are often presented in free-text format. The unstructured nature of these reports presents a significant challenge limiting the accessibility of their content. In this work, we present a practical approach based on the use of large multimodal models (LMMs) for automatically extracting information from scanned images of pathology reports with the goal of generating a standardised report specifying the value of different fields along with estimated confidence about the accuracy of the extracted fields. The proposed approach overcomes limitations of existing methods which do not assign confidence scores to extracted fields limiting their practical use. The proposed framework uses two stages of prompting a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for information extraction and validation. The framework generalises to textual reports from multiple medical centres as well as scanned images of legacy pathology reports. We show that the estimated confidence is an effective indicator of the accuracy of the extracted information that can be used to select only accurately extracted fields. We also show the prognostic significance of structured and unstructured data from pathology reports and show that the automatically extracted field values significant prognostic value for patient stratification. The framework is available for evaluation via the URL: https://labieb.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Beyond Self-Consistency: Ensemble Reasoning Boosts Consistency and Accuracy of LLMs in Cancer Staging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13149v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) have encouraged their adoption in the healthcare domain where vital clinical information is often contained in unstructured notes. Cancer staging status is available in clinical reports, but it requires natural language processing to extract the status from the unstructured text. With the advance in clinical-oriented LLMs, it is promising to extract such status without extensive efforts in training the algorithms. Prompting approaches of the pre-trained LLMs that elicit a model's reasoning process, such as chain-of-thought, may help to improve the trustworthiness of the generated responses. Using self-consistency further improves model performance, but often results in inconsistent generations across the multiple reasoning paths. In this study, we propose an ensemble reasoning approach with the aim of improving the consistency of the model generations. Using an open access clinical large language model to determine the pathologic cancer stage from real-world pathology reports, we show that the ensemble reasoning approach is able to improve both the consistency and performance of the LLM in determining cancer stage, thereby demonstrating the potential to use these models in clinical or other domains where reliability and trustworthiness are critical.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME'24)</p></details> |

In order to reduce the number of positive margins would offer surgeon real-time intra-operative information on the presence of positive resection margins. This study aims to design an intra-operative tumour margin evaluation scheme by using specimen mammography in breast-conserving surgery. Total of 30 cases were evaluated and compared with the manually determined contours by experienced physicians and pathology report. The proposed method utilizes image thresholding to extract regions of interest and then performs a deep learning model, i.e. SegNet, to segment tumour tissue. The margin width of normal tissues surrounding it is evaluated as the result. The desired size of margin around the tumor was set for 10 mm. The smallest average difference to manual sketched margin (6.53 mm +- 5.84). In the all case, the SegNet architecture was utilized to obtain tissue specimen boundary and tumor contour, respectively. The simulation results indicated that this technology is helpful in discriminating positive from negative margins in the intra-operative setting. The aim of proposed scheme was a potential procedure in the intra-operative measurement system.

Information on staging is often included in unstructured form in clinical, pathology, radiology and other free-text reports in the electronic health record system, requiring extensive work to parse and obtain. To facilitate the extraction of this information, previous NLP approaches rely on labeled training datasets, which are labor-intensive to prepare. In this study, we demonstrate that without any labeled training data, open-source clinical large language models (LLMs) can extract pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM) staging information from real-world pathology reports. Our experiments compare LLMs and a BERT-based model fine-tuned using the labeled data. Our findings suggest that while LLMs still exhibit subpar performance in Tumor (T) classification, with the appropriate adoption of prompting strategies, they can achieve comparable performance on Metastasis (M) classification and improved performance on Node (N) classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in the IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (IEEE ICHI 2024)</p></details> |
| **[A comparative study of zero-shot inference with large language models and supervised modeling in breast cancer pathology classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13887v1)** | 2024-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although supervised machine learning is popular for information extraction from clinical notes, creating large annotated datasets requires extensive domain expertise and is time-consuming. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising transfer learning capability. In this study, we explored whether recent LLMs can reduce the need for large-scale data annotations. We curated a manually-labeled dataset of 769 breast cancer pathology reports, labeled with 13 categories, to compare zero-shot classification capability of the GPT-4 model and the GPT-3.5 model with supervised classification performance of three model architectures: random forests classifier, long short-term memory networks with attention (LSTM-Att), and the UCSF-BERT model. Across all 13 tasks, the GPT-4 model performed either significantly better than or as well as the best supervised model, the LSTM-Att model (average macro F1 score of 0.83 vs. 0.75). On tasks with high imbalance between labels, the differences were more prominent. Frequent sources of GPT-4 errors included inferences from multiple samples and complex task design. On complex tasks where large annotated datasets cannot be easily collected, LLMs can reduce the burden of large-scale data labeling. However, if the use of LLMs is prohibitive, the use of simpler supervised models with large annotated datasets can provide comparable results. LLMs demonstrated the potential to speed up the execution of clinical NLP studies by reducing the need for curating large annotated datasets. This may result in an increase in the utilization of NLP-based variables and outcomes in observational clinical studies.</p></details> |  |

Thus, such system can reduce the burden for populating tumor registries, help registration for clinical trial as well as developing large dataset for deep learning model development using true pathologic ground truth. However, the content of breast pathology reports can be difficult for categorize due to the high linguistic variability in content and wide variety of potential diagnoses >50. Existing NLP models are primarily focused on developing classifier for primary breast cancer types (e.g. IDC, DCIS, ILC) and tumor characteristics, and ignore the rare diagnosis of cancer subtypes. We then developed a hierarchical hybrid transformer-based pipeline (59 labels) - Hierarchical Classification System for Breast Cancer Specimen Report (HCSBC), which utilizes the potential of the transformer context-preserving NLP technique and compared our model to several state of the art ML and DL models. We trained the model on the EUH data and evaluated our model's performance on two external datasets - MGH and Mayo Clinic.

The four subtypes are Luminal A (LA), Luminal B (LB), HER2 subtype, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Immunohistochemistry is the gold-standard evaluation, although interobserver variations are reported and molecular signatures identification is time-consuming. Fourier transform infrared micro-spectroscopy with machine learning approaches have been used to evaluate cancer samples, presenting biochemical-related explainability. However, this explainability is harder when using deep learning. This study created a 1D deep learning tool for breast cancer subtype evaluation and biochemical contribution. Sixty hyperspectral images were acquired from a human breast cancer microarray. K-Means clustering was applied to select tissue and paraffin spectra. CaReNet-V1, a novel 1D convolutional neural network, was developed to classify breast cancer (CA) and adjacent tissue (AT), and molecular subtypes. A 1D adaptation of Grad-CAM was applied to assess the biochemical impact to the classifications. CaReNet-V1 effectively classified CA and AT (test accuracy of 0.89), as well as HER2 and TNBC subtypes (0.83 and 0.86), with greater difficulty for LA and LB (0.74 and 0.68). The model enabled the evaluation of the most contributing wavenumbers to the predictions, providing a direct relationship with the biochemical content. Therefore, CaReNet-V1 and hyperspectral images is a potential approach for breast cancer biopsies assessment, providing additional information to the pathology report. Biochemical content impact feature may be used for other studies, such as treatment efficacy evaluation and development new diagnostics and therapeutic methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Validation of a Zero-Shot Learning Natural Language Processing Tool for Data Abstraction from Unstructured Healthcare Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00107v1)** | 2023-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objectives: To describe the development and validation of a zero-shot learning natural language processing (NLP) tool for abstracting data from unstructured text contained within PDF documents, such as those found within electronic health records. Materials and Methods: A data abstraction tool based on the GPT-3.5 model from OpenAI was developed and compared to three physician human abstractors in terms of time to task completion and accuracy for abstracting data on 14 unique variables from a set of 199 de-identified radical prostatectomy pathology reports. The reports were processed by the software tool in vectorized and scanned formats to establish the impact of optical character recognition on data abstraction. The tool was assessed for superiority for data abstraction speed and non-inferiority for accuracy. Results: The human abstractors required a mean of 101s per report for data abstraction, with times varying from 15 to 284 s. In comparison, the software tool required a mean of 12.8 s to process the vectorized reports and a mean of 15.8 to process the scanned reports (P < 0.001). The overall accuracies of the three human abstractors were 94.7%, 97.8%, and 96.4% for the combined set of 2786 datapoints. The software tool had an overall accuracy of 94.2% for the vectorized reports, proving to be non-inferior to the human abstractors at a margin of -10% ($α$=0.025). The tool had a slightly lower accuracy of 88.7% using the scanned reports, proving to be non-inferiority to 2 out of 3 human abstractors. Conclusion: The developed zero-shot learning NLP tool affords researchers comparable levels of accuracy to that of human abstractors, with significant time savings benefits. Because of the lack of need for task-specific model training, the developed tool is highly generalizable and can be used for a wide variety of data abstraction tasks, even outside the field of medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 3 supplementary figures</p></details> |

However, existing works typically train on large datasets of image-text pairs and have been designed to perform downstream tasks involving only small to medium sized-images, neither of which are applicable to the emerging field of computational pathology where there are limited publicly available paired image-text datasets and each image can span up to 100,000 x 100,000 pixels. In this paper we present MI-Zero, a simple and intuitive framework for unleashing the zero-shot transfer capabilities of contrastively aligned image and text models on gigapixel histopathology whole slide images, enabling multiple downstream diagnostic tasks to be carried out by pretrained encoders without requiring any additional labels. MI-Zero reformulates zero-shot transfer under the framework of multiple instance learning to overcome the computational challenge of inference on extremely large images. We used over 550k pathology reports and other available in-domain text corpora to pre-train our text encoder.

| **[A new methodology to predict the oncotype scores based on clinico-pathological data with similar tumor profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06966v1)** | 2023-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introduction: The Oncotype DX (ODX) test is a commercially available molecular test for breast cancer assay that provides prognostic and predictive breast cancer recurrence information for hormone positive, HER2-negative patients. The aim of this study is to propose a novel methodology to assist physicians in their decision-making. Methods: A retrospective study between 2012 and 2020 with 333 cases that underwent an ODX assay from three hospitals in Bourgogne Franche-Comt{é} was conducted. Clinical and pathological reports were used to collect the data. A methodology based on distributional random forest was developed using 9 clinico-pathological characteristics. This methodology can be used particularly to identify the patients of the training cohort that share similarities with the new patient and to predict an estimate of the distribution of the ODX score. Results: The mean age of participants id 56.9 years old. We have correctly classified 92% of patients in low risk and 40.2% of patients in high risk. The overall accuracy is 79.3%. The proportion of low risk correct predicted value (PPV) is 82%. The percentage of high risk correct predicted value (NPV) is approximately 62.3%. The F1-score and the Area Under Curve (AUC) are of 0.87 and 0.759, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed methodology makes it possible to predict the distribution of the ODX score for a patient and provides an explanation of the predicted score. The use of the methodology with the pathologist's expertise on the different histological and immunohistochemical characteristics has a clinical impact to help oncologist in decision-making regarding breast cancer therapy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Precancerous Case Characterization via Transformer-based Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05150v1)** | 2022-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of natural language processing (NLP) to cancer pathology reports has been focused on detecting cancer cases, largely ignoring precancerous cases. Improving the characterization of precancerous adenomas assists in developing diagnostic tests for early cancer detection and prevention, especially for colorectal cancer (CRC). Here we developed transformer-based deep neural network NLP models to perform the CRC phenotyping, with the goal of extracting precancerous lesion attributes and distinguishing cancer and precancerous cases. We achieved 0.914 macro-F1 scores for classifying patients into negative, non-advanced adenoma, advanced adenoma and CRC. We further improved the performance to 0.923 using an ensemble of classifiers for cancer status classification and lesion size named entity recognition (NER). Our results demonstrated the potential of using NLP to leverage real-world health record data to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests for early cancer prevention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimorbidity Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval Using Proxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12185v1)** | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Content-based medical image retrieval is an important diagnostic tool that improves the explainability of computer-aided diagnosis systems and provides decision making support to healthcare professionals. Medical imaging data, such as radiology images, are often multimorbidity; a single sample may have more than one pathology present. As such, image retrieval systems for the medical domain must be designed for the multi-label scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label metric learning method that can be used for both classification and content-based image retrieval. In this way, our model is able to support diagnosis by predicting the presence of diseases and provide evidence for these predictions by returning samples with similar pathological content to the user. In practice, the retrieved images may also be accompanied by pathology reports, further assisting in the diagnostic process. Our method leverages proxy feature vectors, enabling the efficient learning of a robust feature space in which the distance between feature vectors can be used as a measure of the similarity of those samples. Unlike existing proxy-based methods, training samples are able to assign to multiple proxies that span multiple class labels. This multi-label proxy assignment results in a feature space that encodes the complex relationships between diseases present in medical imaging data. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art image retrieval systems and a set of baseline approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to both classification and content-based image retrieval on two multimorbidity radiology datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Objective and Reproducible Osteosarcoma Chemotherapy Response Assessment and Outcome Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04910v1)** | 2022-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer whose standard treatment includes pre-operative chemotherapy followed by resection. Chemotherapy response is used for predicting prognosis and further management of patients. Necrosis is routinely assessed post-chemotherapy from histology slides on resection specimens where necrosis ratio is defined as the ratio of necrotic tumor to overall tumor. Patients with necrosis ratio >=90% are known to have better outcome. Manual microscopic review of necrosis ratio from multiple glass slides is semi-quantitative and can have intra- and inter-observer variability. We propose an objective and reproducible deep learning-based approach to estimate necrosis ratio with outcome prediction from scanned hematoxylin and eosin whole slide images. We collected 103 osteosarcoma cases with 3134 WSIs to train our deep learning model, to validate necrosis ratio assessment, and to evaluate outcome prediction. We trained Deep Multi-Magnification Network to segment multiple tissue subtypes including viable tumor and necrotic tumor in pixel-level and to calculate case-level necrosis ratio from multiple WSIs. We showed necrosis ratio estimated by our segmentation model highly correlates with necrosis ratio from pathology reports manually assessed by experts where mean absolute differences for Grades IV (100%), III (>=90%), and II (>=50% and <90%) necrosis response are 4.4%, 4.5%, and 17.8%, respectively. We successfully stratified patients to predict overall survival with p=10^-6 and progression-free survival with p=0.012. Our reproducible approach without variability enabled us to tune cutoff thresholds, specifically for our model and our data set, to 80% for OS and 60% for PFS. Our study indicates deep learning can support pathologists as an objective tool to analyze osteosarcoma from histology for assessing treatment response and predicting patient outcome.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multistep Automated Data Labelling Procedure (MADLaP) for Thyroid Nodules on Ultrasound: An Artificial Intelligence Approach for Automating Image Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14305v1)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) for diagnosis of thyroid nodules on ultrasound is an active area of research. However, ML tools require large, well-labelled datasets, the curation of which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The purpose of our study was to develop and test a deep-learning-based tool to facilitate and automate the data annotation process for thyroid nodules; we named our tool Multistep Automated Data Labelling Procedure (MADLaP). MADLaP was designed to take multiple inputs included pathology reports, ultrasound images, and radiology reports. Using multiple step-wise modules including rule-based natural language processing, deep-learning-based imaging segmentation, and optical character recognition, MADLaP automatically identified images of a specific thyroid nodule and correctly assigned a pathology label. The model was developed using a training set of 378 patients across our health system and tested on a separate set of 93 patients. Ground truths for both sets were selected by an experienced radiologist. Performance metrics including yield (how many labeled images the model produced) and accuracy (percentage correct) were measured using the test set. MADLaP achieved a yield of 63% and an accuracy of 83%. The yield progressively increased as the input data moved through each module, while accuracy peaked part way through. Error analysis showed that inputs from certain examination sites had lower accuracy (40%) than the other sites (90%, 100%). MADLaP successfully created curated datasets of labeled ultrasound images of thyroid nodules. While accurate, the relatively suboptimal yield of MADLaP exposed some challenges when trying to automatically label radiology images from heterogeneous sources. The complex task of image curation and annotation could be automated, allowing for enrichment of larger datasets for use in machine learning development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why I'm not Answering: Understanding Determinants of Classification of an Abstaining Classifier for Cancer Pathology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05094v5)** | 2022-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe deployment of deep learning systems in critical real world applications requires models to make very few mistakes, and only under predictable circumstances. In this work, we address this problem using an abstaining classifier that is tuned to have $>$95% accuracy, and then identify the determinants of abstention using LIME. Essentially, we are training our model to learn the attributes of pathology reports that are likely to lead to incorrect classifications, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. We demonstrate an abstaining classifier in a multitask setting for classifying cancer pathology reports from the NCI SEER cancer registries on six tasks of interest. For these tasks, we reduce the classification error rate by factors of 2--5 by abstaining on 25--45% of the reports. For the specific task of classifying cancer site, we are able to identify metastasis, reports involving lymph nodes, and discussion of multiple cancer sites as responsible for many of the classification mistakes, and observe that the extent and types of mistakes vary systematically with cancer site (e.g., breast, lung, and prostate). When combining across three of the tasks, our model classifies 50% of the reports with an accuracy greater than 95% for three of the six tasks\edit, and greater than 85% for all six tasks on the retained samples. Furthermore, we show that LIME provides a better determinant of classification than measures of word occurrence alone. By combining a deep abstaining classifier with feature identification using LIME, we are able to identify concepts responsible for both correctness and abstention when classifying cancer sites from pathology reports. The improvement of LIME over keyword searches is statistically significant, presumably because words are assessed in context and have been identified as a local determinant of classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[CancerBERT: a BERT model for Extracting Breast Cancer Phenotypes from Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11303v2)** | 2022-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate extraction of breast cancer patients' phenotypes is important for clinical decision support and clinical research. Current models do not take full advantage of cancer domain-specific corpus, whether pre-training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model on cancer-specific corpus could improve the performances of extracting breast cancer phenotypes from texts data remains to be explored. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the CancerBERT model for extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts in electronic health records. This data used in the study included 21,291 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2020, patients' clinical notes and pathology reports were collected from the University of Minnesota Clinical Data Repository (UMN). Results: About 3 million clinical notes and pathology reports in electronic health records for 21,291 breast cancer patients were collected to train the CancerBERT model. 200 pathology reports and 50 clinical notes of breast cancer patients that contain 9,685 sentences and 221,356 tokens were manually annotated by two annotators. 20% of the annotated data was used as a test set. Our CancerBERT model achieved the best performance with macro F1 scores equal to 0.876 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for exact match and 0.904 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for the lenient match. The NER models we developed would facilitate the automated information extraction from clinical texts to further help clinical decision support. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, we focused on the breast cancer-related concepts extraction from EHR data and obtained a comprehensive annotated dataset that contains 7 types of breast cancer-related concepts. The CancerBERT model with customized vocabulary could significantly improve the performance for extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural language processing to identify lupus nephritis phenotype in electronic health records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10821v1)** | 2021-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by an unpredictable course of flares and remission with diverse manifestations. Lupus nephritis, one of the major disease manifestations of SLE for organ damage and mortality, is a key component of lupus classification criteria. Accurately identifying lupus nephritis in electronic health records (EHRs) would therefore benefit large cohort observational studies and clinical trials where characterization of the patient population is critical for recruitment, study design, and analysis. Lupus nephritis can be recognized through procedure codes and structured data, such as laboratory tests. However, other critical information documenting lupus nephritis, such as histologic reports from kidney biopsies and prior medical history narratives, require sophisticated text processing to mine information from pathology reports and clinical notes. In this study, we developed algorithms to identify lupus nephritis with and without natural language processing (NLP) using EHR data. We developed four algorithms: a rule-based algorithm using only structured data (baseline algorithm) and three algorithms using different NLP models. The three NLP models are based on regularized logistic regression and use different sets of features including positive mention of concept unique identifiers (CUIs), number of appearances of CUIs, and a mixture of three components respectively. The baseline algorithm and the best performed NLP algorithm were external validated on a dataset from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). Our best performing NLP model incorporating features from both structured data, regular expression concepts, and mapped CUIs improved F measure in both the NMEDW (0.41 vs 0.79) and VUMC (0.62 vs 0.96) datasets compared to the baseline lupus nephritis algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gram Barcodes for Histopathology Tissue Texture Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15519v1)** | 2021-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in digital pathology have led to the need for Histopathology Image Retrieval (HIR) systems that search through databases of biopsy images to find similar cases to a given query image. These HIR systems allow pathologists to effortlessly and efficiently access thousands of previously diagnosed cases in order to exploit the knowledge in the corresponding pathology reports. Since HIR systems may have to deal with millions of gigapixel images, the extraction of compact and expressive image features must be available to allow for efficient and accurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the application of Gram barcodes as image features for HIR systems. Unlike most feature generation schemes, Gram barcodes are based on high-order statistics that describe tissue texture by summarizing the correlations between different feature maps in layers of convolutional neural networks. We run HIR experiments on three public datasets using a pre-trained VGG19 network for Gram barcode generation and showcase highly competitive results.</p></details> |  |

An essential step in constructing large-scale MKG is extracting information from medical reports. Recently, information extraction techniques have been proposed and show promising performance in biomedical information extraction. However, these methods only consider limited types of entity and relation due to the noisy biomedical text data with complex entity correlations. Thus, they fail to provide enough information for constructing MKGs and restrict the downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose Biomedical Information Extraction, a hybrid neural network to extract relations from biomedical text and unstructured medical reports. Our model utilizes a multi-head attention enhanced graph convolutional network to capture the complex relations and context information while resisting the noise from the data. We evaluate our model on two major biomedical relationship extraction tasks, chemical-disease relation and chemical-protein interaction, and a cross-hospital pan-cancer pathology report corpus. The results show that our method achieves superior performance than baselines. Furthermore, we evaluate the applicability of our method under a transfer learning setting and show that BioIE achieves promising performance in processing medical text from different formats and writing styles.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2021 accepted, including 9 pages, 1 figure</p></details> |

This lead to the current generalized standards that are being continuously updated as new findings are reported. It is noticeable that these effective standards are developed based on a multi-source heterogeneous data, including whole-slide images and pathology and clinical reports. In this study, we propose a framework that combines pathological images and medical reports to generate a personalized diagnosis result for individual patient. We use nuclei-level image feature similarity and content-based deep learning method to search for a personalized group of population with similar pathological characteristics, extract structured prognostic information from descriptive pathology reports of the similar patient population, and assign importance of different prognostic factors to generate a personalized pathological diagnosis result. We use multi-source heterogeneous data from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database. The result demonstrate that our framework matches the performance of pathologists in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. This framework is designed to be generic, thus could be applied for other types of cancer. The weights could provide insights to the known prognostic factors and further guide more precise clinical treatment protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>BIBM ...</summary><p>BIBM 2021 accepted, including 9 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

Extracting details of the colonoscopy findings from free text in electronic health records (EHRs) can be used to determine patient risk for CRC and colorectal screening strategies. We developed and evaluated the accuracy of a deep learning model framework to extract information for the clinical decision support system to interpret relevant free-text reports, including indications, pathology, and findings notes. The Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF framework was developed using Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to extract several clinical features from these free-text reports including indications for the colonoscopy, findings during the colonoscopy, and pathology of resected material. We trained the Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and existing Bi-LSTM-CRF models on 80% of 4,000 manually annotated notes from 3,867 patients. These clinical notes were from a group of patients over 40 years of age enrolled in four Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. A total of 10% of the remaining annotated notes were used to train hyperparameter and the remaining 10% were used to evaluate the accuracy of our model Bio-Bi-LSTM-CRF and compare to Bi-LSTM-CRF.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Integration of Domain Knowledge using Medical Knowledge Graph Deep Learning for Cancer Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01337v1)** | 2021-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key component of deep learning (DL) for natural language processing (NLP) is word embeddings. Word embeddings that effectively capture the meaning and context of the word that they represent can significantly improve the performance of downstream DL models for various NLP tasks. Many existing word embeddings techniques capture the context of words based on word co-occurrence in documents and text; however, they often cannot capture broader domain-specific relationships between concepts that may be crucial for the NLP task at hand. In this paper, we propose a method to integrate external knowledge from medical terminology ontologies into the context captured by word embeddings. Specifically, we use a medical knowledge graph, such as the unified medical language system (UMLS), to find connections between clinical terms in cancer pathology reports. This approach aims to minimize the distance between connected clinical concepts. We evaluate the proposed approach using a Multitask Convolutional Neural Network (MT-CNN) to extract six cancer characteristics -- site, subsite, laterality, behavior, histology, and grade -- from a dataset of ~900K cancer pathology reports. The results show that the MT-CNN model which uses our domain informed embeddings outperforms the same MT-CNN using standard word2vec embeddings across all tasks, with an improvement in the overall micro- and macro-F1 scores by 4.97\%and 22.5\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enriched Annotations for Tumor Attribute Classification from Pathology Reports with Limited Labeled Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08113v1)** | 2020-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision medicine has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but much of the data for patients is locked away in unstructured free-text, limiting research and delivery of effective personalized treatments. Generating large annotated datasets for information extraction from clinical notes is often challenging and expensive due to the high level of expertise needed for high quality annotations. To enable natural language processing for small dataset sizes, we develop a novel enriched hierarchical annotation scheme and algorithm, Supervised Line Attention (SLA), and apply this algorithm to predicting categorical tumor attributes from kidney and colon cancer pathology reports from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Whereas previous work only annotated document level labels, we in addition ask the annotators to enrich the traditional label by asking them to also highlight the relevant line or potentially lines for the final label, which leads to a 20% increase of annotation time required per document. With the enriched annotations, we develop a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm that first predicts the relevant lines in the document and then predicts the tumor attribute. Our results show across the small dataset sizes of 32, 64, 128, and 186 labeled documents per cancer, SLA only requires half the number of labeled documents as state-of-the-art methods to achieve similar or better micro-f1 and macro-f1 scores for the vast majority of comparisons that we made. Accounting for the increased annotation time, this leads to a 40% reduction in total annotation time over the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality with A.I.-based Gleason Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05197v1)** | 2020-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gleason grading of prostate cancer is an important prognostic factor but suffers from poor reproducibility, particularly among non-subspecialist pathologists. Although artificial intelligence (A.I.) tools have demonstrated Gleason grading on-par with expert pathologists, it remains an open question whether A.I. grading translates to better prognostication. In this study, we developed a system to predict prostate-cancer specific mortality via A.I.-based Gleason grading and subsequently evaluated its ability to risk-stratify patients on an independent retrospective cohort of 2,807 prostatectomy cases from a single European center with 5-25 years of follow-up (median: 13, interquartile range 9-17). The A.I.'s risk scores produced a C-index of 0.84 (95%CI 0.80-0.87) for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Upon discretizing these risk scores into risk groups analogous to pathologist Grade Groups (GG), the A.I. had a C-index of 0.82 (95%CI 0.78-0.85). On the subset of cases with a GG in the original pathology report (n=1,517), the A.I.'s C-indices were 0.87 and 0.85 for continuous and discrete grading, respectively, compared to 0.79 (95%CI 0.71-0.86) for GG obtained from the reports. These represent improvements of 0.08 (95%CI 0.01-0.15) and 0.07 (95%CI 0.00-0.14) respectively. Our results suggest that A.I.-based Gleason grading can lead to effective risk-stratification and warrants further evaluation for improving disease management.</p></details> |  |

The annotation is extensive for the large volume of cancer pathology reports the registry receives annually from public and private sector institutions. This manual process, coupled with other challenges results in a significant 4-year lag in reporting of annual cancer statistics in South Africa. We present a hierarchical deep learning ensemble method incorporating state of the art convolutional neural network models for the automatic labelling of 2201 de-identified, free text pathology reports, with appropriate ICD-O breast cancer topography codes across 8 classes. Our results show an improvement in primary site classification over the state of the art CNN model by greater than 14% for F1 micro and 55% for F1 macro scores.

| **[Model Reduction of Shallow CNN Model for Reliable Deployment of Information Extraction from Medical Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01572v1)** | 2020-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shallow Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is a time-tested tool for the information extraction from cancer pathology reports. Shallow CNN performs competitively on this task to other deep learning models including BERT, which holds the state-of-the-art for many NLP tasks. The main insight behind this eccentric phenomenon is that the information extraction from cancer pathology reports require only a small number of domain-specific text segments to perform the task, thus making the most of the texts and contexts excessive for the task. Shallow CNN model is well-suited to identify these key short text segments from the labeled training set; however, the identified text segments remain obscure to humans. In this study, we fill this gap by developing a model reduction tool to make a reliable connection between CNN filters and relevant text segments by discarding the spurious connections. We reduce the complexity of shallow CNN representation by approximating it with a linear transformation of n-gram presence representation with a non-negativity and sparsity prior on the transformation weights to obtain an interpretable model. Our approach bridge the gap between the conventionally perceived trade-off boundary between accuracy on the one side and explainability on the other by model reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Divide-and-Rule: Self-Supervised Learning for Survival Analysis in Colorectal Cancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03292v1)** | 2020-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the long-term rapid increase in incidences of colorectal cancer (CRC), there is an urgent clinical need to improve risk stratification. The conventional pathology report is usually limited to only a few histopathological features. However, most of the tumor microenvironments used to describe patterns of aggressive tumor behavior are ignored. In this work, we aim to learn histopathological patterns within cancerous tissue regions that can be used to improve prognostic stratification for colorectal cancer. To do so, we propose a self-supervised learning method that jointly learns a representation of tissue regions as well as a metric of the clustering to obtain their underlying patterns. These histopathological patterns are then used to represent the interaction between complex tissues and predict clinical outcomes directly. We furthermore show that the proposed approach can benefit from linear predictors to avoid overfitting in patient outcomes predictions. To this end, we introduce a new well-characterized clinicopathological dataset, including a retrospective collective of 374 patients, with their survival time and treatment information. Histomorphological clusters obtained by our method are evaluated by training survival models. The experimental results demonstrate statistically significant patient stratification, and our approach outperformed the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods.</p></details> |  |

We compare alternative architectures in terms of prediction accuracy and interpretability and show that our best model achieves a multiclass accuracy of 90.3% on topography site assignment and 84.8% on morphology type assignment. We found that in this context hierarchical models are not better than flat models and that an element-wise maximum aggregator is slightly better than attentive models on site classification. Moreover, the maximum aggregator offers a way to interpret the classification process.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (J-BHI)</p></details> |

However, manual classification for a huge number of reports on multiple tasks is labor-intensive. In this paper, we have developed an automatic text classifier based on BERT and we propose a human-centric metric to evaluate the model. According to the model confidence, we identify low-confidence cases that require further expert annotation and high-confidence cases that are automatically classified. We report the percentage of low-confidence cases and the performance of automatically classified cases. On the high-confidence cases, the model achieves classification accuracy comparable to pathologists. This leads a potential of reducing 80% to 98% of the manual annotation workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>Machi...</summary><p>Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) at NeurIPS 2019 - Extended Abstract</p></details> |

Traditional methods such as taskspecific end-to-end models and pipeline models usually suffer from the lack of dataset and error propagation. In this paper, we present a question answering based clinical text structuring (QA-CTS) task to unify different specific tasks and make dataset shareable. A novel model that aims to introduce domain-specific features (e.g., clinical named entity information) into pre-trained language model is also proposed for QA-CTS task. Experimental results on Chinese pathology reports collected from Ruijing Hospital demonstrate our presented QA-CTS task is very effective to improve the performance on specific tasks. Our proposed model also competes favorably with strong baseline models in specific tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Prostate Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04918v3)** | 2019-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current study detects different morphologies related to prostate pathology using deep learning models; these models were evaluated on 2,121 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain histology images captured using bright field microscopy, which spanned a variety of image qualities, origins (whole slide, tissue micro array, whole mount, Internet), scanning machines, timestamps, H&E staining protocols, and institutions. For case usage, these models were applied for the annotation tasks in clinician-oriented pathology reports for prostatectomy specimens. The true positive rate (TPR) for slides with prostate cancer was 99.7% by a false positive rate of 0.785%. The F1-scores of Gleason patterns reported in pathology reports ranged from 0.795 to 1.0 at the case level. TPR was 93.6% for the cribriform morphology and 72.6% for the ductal morphology. The correlation between the ground truth and the prediction for the relative tumor volume was 0.987 n. Our models cover the major components of prostate pathology and successfully accomplish the annotation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Multitask Representation Learning for Pathology Biobank Metadata Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07846v1)** | 2019-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metadata are general characteristics of the data in a well-curated and condensed format, and have been proven to be useful for decision making, knowledge discovery, and also heterogeneous data organization of biobank. Among all data types in the biobank, pathology is the key component of the biobank and also serves as the gold standard of diagnosis. To maximize the utility of biobank and allow the rapid progress of biomedical science, it is essential to organize the data with well-populated pathology metadata. However, manual annotation of such information is tedious and time-consuming. In the study, we develop a multimodal multitask learning framework to predict four major slide-level metadata of pathology images. The framework learns generalizable representations across tissue slides, pathology reports, and case-level structured data. We demonstrate improved performance across all four tasks with the proposed method compared to a single modal single task baseline on two test sets, one external test set from a distinct data source (TCGA) and one internal held-out test set (TTH). In the test sets, the performance improvements on the averaged area under receiver operating characteristic curve across the four tasks are 16.48% and 9.05% on TCGA and TTH, respectively. Such pathology metadata prediction system may be adopted to mitigate the effort of expert annotation and ultimately accelerate the data-driven research by better utilization of the pathology biobank.</p></details> | preprint version |
| **[Automatic Classification of Pathology Reports using TF-IDF Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07406v1)** | 2019-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Pathology report is arguably one of the most important documents in medicine containing interpretive information about the visual findings from the patient's biopsy sample. Each pathology report has a retention period of up to 20 years after the treatment of a patient. Cancer registries process and encode high volumes of free-text pathology reports for surveillance of cancer and tumor diseases all across the world. In spite of their extremely valuable information they hold, pathology reports are not used in any systematic way to facilitate computational pathology. Therefore, in this study, we investigate automated machine-learning techniques to identify/predict the primary diagnosis (based on ICD-O code) from pathology reports. We performed experiments by extracting the TF-IDF features from the reports and classifying them using three different methods---SVM, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. We constructed a new dataset with 1,949 pathology reports arranged into 37 ICD-O categories, collected from four different primary sites, namely lung, kidney, thymus, and testis. The reports were manually transcribed into text format after collecting them as PDF files from NCI Genomic Data Commons public dataset. We subsequently pre-processed the reports by removing irrelevant textual artifacts produced by OCR software. The highest classification accuracy we achieved was 92\% using XGBoost classifier on TF-IDF feature vectors, the linear SVM scored 87\% accuracy. Furthermore, the study shows that TF-IDF vectors are suitable for highlighting the important keywords within a report which can be helpful for the cancer research and diagnostic workflow. The results are encouraging in demonstrating the potential of machine learning methods for classification and encoding of pathology reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Relevant Word Order Vectorization for Improved Natural Language Processing in Electronic Healthcare Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02627v1)** | 2018-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) represent a rich resource for conducting observational studies, supporting clinical trials, and more. However, much of the relevant information is stored in an unstructured format that makes it difficult to use. Natural language processing approaches that attempt to automatically classify the data depend on vectorization algorithms that impose structure on the text, but these algorithms were not designed for the unique characteristics of EHR. Here, we propose a new algorithm for structuring so-called free-text that may help researchers make better use of EHR. We call this method Relevant Word Order Vectorization (RWOV). Materials and Methods: As a proof-of-concept, we attempted to classify the hormone receptor status of breast cancer patients treated at the University of Kansas Medical Center during a recent year, from the unstructured text of pathology reports. Our approach attempts to account for the semi-structured way that healthcare providers often enter information. We compared this approach to the ngrams and word2vec methods. Results: Our approach resulted in the most consistently high accuracy, as measured by F1 score and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Discussion: Our results suggest that methods of structuring free text that take into account its context may show better performance, and that our approach is promising. Conclusion: By using a method that accounts for the fact that healthcare providers tend to use certain key words repetitively and that the order of these key words is important, we showed improved performance over methods that do not.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving pathology reports using business intelligence techniques: An experimental study](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03550v1)** | 2016-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Health professionals use pathology reports to monitor and manage a patient's health. Typically, pathologists diagnose patients' conditions and produce these reports which are then used as reference by clinicians and eventually shared with the patient. Pathology reports are difficult to interpret as the reports are written using complex medical terminology. As patients only see their doctors for a limited time, the complexity of report content and the manner in which the information is presented in the reports may hinder patients' understanding of their medical condition and prognosis. The objective of this study was to compare patient comprehension of results from two pathology-reporting styles: the traditional format in current widespread use and new style developed using techniques common in business intelligence system (BI) development. The study found that the reports prepared using a "BI style" improve experimental subject's understanding and satisfaction with the reports.</p></details> | <details><summary>ISBN#...</summary><p>ISBN# 978-0-646-95337-3 Presented at the Australasian Conference on Information Systems 2015 (arXiv:1605.01032)</p></details> |

| **[MPath: Multimodal Pathology Report Generation from Whole Slide Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11906v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated generation of diagnostic pathology reports directly from whole slide images (WSIs) is an emerging direction in computational pathology. Translating high-resolution tissue patterns into clinically coherent text remains difficult due to large morphological variability and the complex structure of pathology narratives. We introduce MPath, a lightweight multimodal framework that conditions a pretrained biomedical language model (BioBART) on WSI-derived visual embeddings through a learned visual-prefix prompting mechanism. Instead of end-to-end vision-language pretraining, MPath leverages foundation-model WSI features (CONCH + Titan) and injects them into BioBART via a compact projection module, keeping the language backbone frozen for stability and data efficiency. MPath was developed and evaluated on the RED 2025 Grand Challenge dataset and ranked 4th in Test Phase 2, despite limited submission opportunities. The results highlight the potential of prompt-based multimodal conditioning as a scalable and interpretable strategy for pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pages...</summary><p>Pages 4, Figures 1, Table 1</p></details> |
| **[DiagR1: A Vision-Language Model Trained via Reinforcement Learning for Digestive Pathology Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18433v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency: pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text, while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation. Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors, demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Historical Report Guided Bi-modal Concurrent Learning for Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18658v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2) inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists' diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation. Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the necessity of our proposed modules, highlighting our method's ability to provide WSI-relevant rich semantic content and suppress information redundancy in WSIs.

| **[On the Importance of Text Preprocessing for Multimodal Representation Learning and Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19285v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models in pathology enable multimodal case retrieval and automated report generation. Many of the models developed so far, however, have been trained on pathology reports that include information which cannot be inferred from paired whole slide images (e.g., patient history), potentially leading to hallucinated sentences in generated reports. To this end, we investigate how the selection of information from pathology reports for vision-language modeling affects the quality of the multimodal representations and generated reports. More concretely, we compare a model trained on full reports against a model trained on preprocessed reports that only include sentences describing the cell and tissue appearances based on the H&E-stained slides. For the experiments, we built upon the BLIP-2 framework and used a cutaneous melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,433 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,636 corresponding pathology reports. Model performance was assessed using image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, as well as qualitative evaluation of the generated reports by an expert pathologist. Our results demonstrate that text preprocessing prevents hallucination in report generation. Despite the improvement in the quality of the generated reports, training the vision-language model on full reports showed better cross-modal retrieval performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Pathology Report Generation and Multimodal Representation Learning for Cutaneous Melanocytic Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19293v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Millions of melanocytic skin lesions are examined by pathologists each year, the majority of which concern common nevi (i.e., ordinary moles). While most of these lesions can be diagnosed in seconds, writing the corresponding pathology report is much more time-consuming. Automating part of the report writing could, therefore, alleviate the increasing workload of pathologists. In this work, we develop a vision-language model specifically for the pathology domain of cutaneous melanocytic lesions. The model follows the Contrastive Captioner framework and was trained and evaluated using a melanocytic lesion dataset of 42,512 H&E-stained whole slide images and 19,645 corresponding pathology reports. Our results show that the quality scores of model-generated reports were on par with pathologist-written reports for common nevi, assessed by an expert pathologist in a reader study. While report generation revealed to be more difficult for rare melanocytic lesion subtypes, the cross-modal retrieval performance for these cases was considerably better.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.19285</p></details> |
| **[PolyPath: Adapting a Large Multimodal Model for Multi-slide Pathology Report Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10536v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interpretation of histopathology cases underlies many important diagnostic and treatment decisions in medicine. Notably, this process typically requires pathologists to integrate and summarize findings across multiple slides per case. Existing vision-language capabilities in computational pathology have so far been largely limited to small regions of interest, larger regions at low magnification, or single whole-slide images (WSIs). This limits interpretation of findings that span multiple high-magnification regions across multiple WSIs. By making use of Gemini 1.5 Flash, a large multimodal model (LMM) with a 1-million token context window, we demonstrate the ability to generate bottom-line diagnoses from up to 40,000 768x768 pixel image patches from multiple WSIs at 10X magnification. This is the equivalent of up to 11 hours of video at 1 fps. Expert pathologist evaluations demonstrate that the generated report text is clinically accurate and equivalent to or preferred over the original reporting for 68% (95% CI: [60%, 76%]) of multi-slide examples with up to 5 slides. While performance decreased for examples with 6 or more slides, this study demonstrates the promise of leveraging the long-context capabilities of modern LMMs for the uniquely challenging task of medical report generation where each case can contain thousands of image patches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 mai...</summary><p>8 main pages, 21 pages in total</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Whole Slide Foundation Model for Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19666v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of computational pathology has been transformed with recent advances in foundation models that encode histopathology region-of-interests (ROIs) into versatile and transferable feature representations via self-supervised learning (SSL). However, translating these advancements to address complex clinical challenges at the patient and slide level remains constrained by limited clinical data in disease-specific cohorts, especially for rare clinical conditions. We propose TITAN, a multimodal whole slide foundation model pretrained using 335,645 WSIs via visual self-supervised learning and vision-language alignment with corresponding pathology reports and 423,122 synthetic captions generated from a multimodal generative AI copilot for pathology. Without any finetuning or requiring clinical labels, TITAN can extract general-purpose slide representations and generate pathology reports that generalize to resource-limited clinical scenarios such as rare disease retrieval and cancer prognosis. We evaluate TITAN on diverse clinical tasks and find that TITAN outperforms both ROI and slide foundation models across machine learning settings such as linear probing, few-shot and zero-shot classification, rare cancer retrieval and cross-modal retrieval, and pathology report generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN</p></details> |

However, their use in pathology report generation for whole slide images (WSIs) is still limited due to the huge size of multi-scale WSIs and the high cost of WSI annotation. Moreover, in most of the existing research on pathology report generation, sufficient validation regarding clinical efficacy has not been conducted. Herein, we propose a novel Patient-level Multi-organ Pathology Report Generation (PMPRG) model, which utilizes the multi-scale WSI features from our proposed multi-scale regional vision transformer (MR-ViT) model and their real pathology reports to guide VLM training for accurate pathology report generation. The model then automatically generates a report based on the provided key features attended regional features. We assessed our model using a WSI dataset consisting of multiple organs, including the colon and kidney. Our model achieved a METEOR score of 0.68, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. This model allows pathologists to efficiently generate pathology reports for patients, regardless of the number of WSIs involved.</p></details> |  |
